## Development

We're currently at work labeling thousands of sentences for our models! If you want to see some of our WIP models just head over to `src/model_dev`. Otherwise check back later for dataset & model releases.

## Thanks

ClimateMind has been made possible thanks to Microsoft's AI for Earth grant. Which provides us with the compute resources nesscerary to label our data & train our models. Learn more about the program [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-for-earth).
