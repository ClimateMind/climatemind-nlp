                    "More frequent heat waves due to climate change are disrupting students\u2019 test scores, impacting their ability to achieve their goals. Studies show that as temperatures rise, our brain functions slow down. College students taking identical exams had an 11% lower chance of passing when the temperature was 90 degrees Fahrenheit compared to 72 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nAir conditioning is a potential solution, but comes with its own challenges. For many people around the world air conditioning is unaffordable. 87% of homes in the US have air conditioning compared to only 5% of homes in India. Even within the US access to air conditioning is not evenly distributed throughout society. School districts in wealthy areas have money to afford air conditioning, improving the test scores of their students and widening the education gap. Even with equitable air conditioning, the electrical consumption, and therefore greenhouse gas emissions, of more air conditioners need to be considered. Deploying solutions which fight climate change will help educate the students of tomorrow and allow them to achieve their goals and contribute to society."

Climate change induces health effects that are varied and diverse, and include respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, premature deaths due to extreme weather events, changes in the prevalence and geographical distribution of food- and water-borne illnesses and other infectious diseases, and threats to mental health.\n\nJust 10 extreme events associated with climate change in 2012 cost the United States $1.6 billion in healthcare and lost wages, according to the National Resources Defense Council.  In total, these events, stretching from Washington to Florida, led to an estimated 917 deaths, more than 20,000 hospitalizations and nearly $10 billion (in 2018 dollars) in health-related costs. The two highest estimated costs events were for Hurricane Sandy at $3.2 billion and wildfires in Washington at $2.3 billion.\n\nAs humans continue emitting heat-trapping gasses and climate change continues to intensify,  its effects on health worsen too. These highlight the need to take mitigation actions against climate change and adapt to its unavoidable health impacts."

These majestic creatures have evolved to live in colder climates. As heatwaves become more frequent and severe, these animals become heat-stressed and have access to less suitable habitat. By 2050, the total habitat for all mammals is expected to decline globally by 5%\u201316% of the 2015 level. This can be seen in Minnesota, where a decrease in moose population from 4,000 in 1983 to 100 in 2008 coincided with an average temperature increase of 3 to 4 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nIn addition to reduced habitat, warmer temperatures have enabled the increase in winter ticks. Moose have been found with 50,000 to 70,000 ticks (ten to twenty times more than normal). Ticks weaken the moose and leave them more susceptible to disease. As temperatures continue to rise, viewing and hunting opportunities will continue to decrease. Without intervention we could soon see the loss of this big-game animal."

                    "Climate change and rising temperatures are strongly linked to increasing suicide rates, threatening the stability of the future generation\u2019s prosperity. In the United States, suicide is the second most-common cause of death among Americans between 10 and 34 years of age  and the rates continue to climb. If a month is 1 degree Celsius warmer than normal, then its suicide rate will increase by 0.7 percent in the United States and 2.1 percent in Mexico. Given the warming trends from our continued emissions of heat-trapping gases, Stanford researchers found the US and Mexico can expect between 9,000 to 40,000 additional suicides by 2050 if significant action is not taken. A European study conducted in 2016 found climatic indicators to be a better predictor of suicide than socioeconomic factors after studying 29 countries over 13 years.\n\nStudies have found heat waves have the ability to affect our capacity to regulate our emotions, leading to other mental health issues such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder in addition to suicide. Combatting these psychological effects is a national concern and requires serious investments in money and time. Across the US, $232,000 is spent for every 1,000 employees on treatments for these mental health issues and lost work time. Notably, availability of air conditioners does not prevent the impacts of heat on suicide. In addition to increased funding for suicide prevention, hospitals and other organizations can work to disseminate information on building individual resiliency behaviors. Investing in these preventative measures and addressing climate change could save thousands of lives from suicide alone."

                    "Gross Domestic Profit (GDP) is a measure of the health of the economy. GDP is already significantly smaller than it could be due to the effects of global warming. Each 1.8\u00b0 Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius) of warming reduces growth by 1% on average, and the planet has already warmed by 1.8\u00b0 Fahrenheit. One reason for this is an increased frequency of heat waves and extreme temperatures. \n\nHeat affects people's ability to concentrate and their health, causing lower labor productivity and employee absenteeism, which in turn affect the success of companies and their contribution to the economy. Studies indicate an average 2% decrease in work performance per \u00b0C temperature rise (1.8\u00b0 F) when the temperature is above 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F). \n\nThe frequency of intense heat waves (4-day, 1-in-5 year events) has generally increased since the 1960s in most regions. It's projected that heatwaves will lead to a $2 trillion loss in labor productivity by 2030. Additionally, marine heatwaves damage and kill coral reefs (which are worth $36 billion a year to the world economy), affecting tourism and the fishing industry and further contributing to the decline in GDP.\n\nIf appropriate adaptation and mitigation measures aren't taken, as global temperatures continue to rise we can expect a 7.2% cut to GDP per person worldwide and a 10.5% cut in the USA by 2100. Taking action now to cut emissions in line with the international Paris agreement could limit the loss to 1.1%, helping to protect the economy and people's livelihoods."

This is an occupational health and safety issue and negatively affects the success of companies and their contribution to the economy.\n\nFor every 1.8\u00b0F (1 \u00b0C) rise in temperatures above 77\u00b0F (25\u00b0C) there is an average 2% decrease in work performance. This is due to both physiological and cognitive impairment caused by heat exhaustion and dehydration, and a higher risk of injury. High heat negatively affects people in offices with no or inadequate air conditioning, and those working outside such as agriculture, construction and logistics workers. People are also more likely to stay home during heat waves, with resulting loss of income. To make up for reduced output, workers have to work longer hours or more workers have to be hired, both of which cause higher costs to the organization.\n\nHuman-caused climate change is already having impacts on worker productivity. The frequency of intense heat waves (4-day, 1-in-5 year events) has generally increased since the 1960s in most regions.   Already up to 10-15% of annual daylight hours are so hot that productivity is lost. It's projected that heatwaves will lead to a $2 trillion loss in labor productivity by 2030."

A 2019 US Defense Department report estimates two-thirds of military installations in the USA will be at risk in the next two decades. Including American territories and foreign nations, the US military has more than 300,000 buildings globally, many of which will be under threat from climate change impacts. Rebuilding and making bases more resilient is expensive. For example, in 2018 Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida was heavily damaged by Hurricane Michael and will cost at least $4.25 billion to rebuild.\n\nThis example illustrates how climate change is a threat to national security. So it's critical to implement actions that avert future damage and prevent the threat from worsening beyond control by reducing emissions as much as possible."

                    "Air pollution refers to any pollutant in the air which can harm human health. Over time, the amount of pollution in the air has increased due to human activity, disproportionately affecting the wellbeing of children. A large part of a child\u2019s lung develops after birth. Because of this, exposure to increased levels of pollution puts children at a greater risk of reduced lung growth, respiratory infections, and developing future chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease. Approximately 93% of the world\u2019s children under the age of 15 breathe air that is harmful to their health. In 2016 alone, it was estimated 600,000 children died from acute lower respiratory infections related to polluted air. \n\nStudies have been conducted which show that reducing air pollution can protect against these harmful impacts. A 2016 report looked at children living in Southern California across three separate time periods (1993-2001, 1996-2004, 2003-2012) and found the children living during periods of better air quality suffered fewer bronchial symptoms. The WHO recommends policies such as the use of renewable energy to curb emissions, to improve air quality and help secure children\u2019s futures around the world."

In the US, 20% of people who die from lung cancer have never smoked or used tobacco. And globally, exposure to air pollution has been the fourth highest global mortality risk factor. Burning fossil fuels releases particulate matter (PM), which causes an increased risk for lung cancer under long term exposure. The number of deaths related to PM 2.5 exposure have increased from 3.5 million in 1990 to 4.2 million in 2015.\n\nParticulate matter can also come from sources other than fossil fuels, such as from toxic smoke from wildfires that burn larger areas of land due to human-induced climate change.   Policies that limit heat-trapping gases are needed to prevent runaway climate change and to preserve our health and wellbeing by preventing the creation of toxic air pollution from burning fossil fuels."

                    "Recent years have seen record-shattering wildfires seasons. Although not the only factor, climate change is contributing to larger, more severe wildfires, and longer wildfire seasons. Warming temperatures and lower precipitation dry out vegetation and soils, allowing fuel to accumulate and making wildfires more likely. Estimates suggest human-caused climate change has doubled the cumulative forest fire area since 1984 and extended the wildfire season by 78 days relative to the 1970s\u2014almost three additional months per year when a fire could start. Under conservative levels of future warming, 11 states in the U.S. are predicted to experience an increase of 200% or more in average burned area for 2010-2039 relative to 1961-2004 levels.\n\nIncreasing wildfire size and severity pose an enormous threat to animal and human life and property, as vividly demonstrated by the 2020 wildfires in places as disparate as California, Australia, and Brazil. This threat is compounded by increasing human development in fire-prone areas such as forest and chaparral habitats. Policies designed to prevent wildfires such as prescribed burns, which remove fuel from the landscape, can help mitigate this threat, as can individual actions including creating defensible space around homes and buildings. However, curbing the trend of increasing wildfire size and severity will likely require aggressive climate policy aimed at limiting the magnitude of future warming."

                    "Between 1980 and 2019, climate-related disasters in the US caused $1.75 trillion total in losses. And in the past three years alone, the annual number of climate-related disasters costing over a billion dollars has doubled relative to the past; events are happening more frequently, with 28 of them occurring in 2018 and 2019 alone. These costly events often include large hurricanes, putting our coastal communities most at risk.\n\nWith the continued emissions of heat trapping gases by humans, we are driving oceans to warm, fueling more powerful hurricanes. Additionally, this warming is causing hurricanes to more frequently and rapidly intensify and sometimes even stall, where hurricanes grow in strength very quickly and then move very slowly over land, inflicting even more costly damage. \nAs of 2020, the five costliest hurricanes of all time each occurred after 2005 (Irma 2017, Sandy 2012, Maria 2017, Harvey 2017, Katrina 2005) and totaled $497 billion in associated losses. Human-induced climate change played a significant role in increasing these damages. For example, the warming from human heat-trapping emissions have made hurricanes Katrina, Irma and Maria drop upwards to 9 percent more rainfall, increasing flood damages. Reducing emissions and preparing our cities are key to keep our communities safe."

                    "Corals depend on symbiotic algae (small marine 'plants' which live inside the corals) for energy. Global warming causes increases in ocean temperatures, which increase the frequency of marine heatwaves. These high temperatures stress corals and cause them to release the algae, so the corals become colourless and will die without algae. Half the world's reef systems have already been destroyed.\n\nCoral reefs have the highest biodiversity of all marine ecosystems on the planet. They are important habitats for many fish species. Many people also highly value coral reefs for their beauty.  Corals come in a rich array of colours and shapes, and shelter a wide range of marine life from sea turtles to brightly-coloured clownfish and angelfish. Parrotfish graze on the reefs themselves, producing the fine white sand characteristic of tropical beaches.\n\nReefs are also valuable fishery grounds and tourist destinations. They help protect coastlines from erosion and storms. So as well as being of high intrinsic value, the loss of coral reefs threatens economies and leads to property damage.\n\nUnder climate change, marine heatwaves have doubled since 1982. If CO2 emissions aren't reduced, in the future these heatwaves will occur 50 times more often than they do today. To protect our valuable coral reef systems, we need to act to reduce emissions now."

                    "Tourism supports the livelihoods of an estimated one in ten people worldwide andaround 80% occurs around coastal destinations. Coral reefs are popular and exciting places for sightseeing, swimming, snorkelling, diving and boating. For example, Australia's Great Barrier Reef annually attracts 1.9 million visits, generates AUD$5.4 billion from tourism and supports 54,000 jobs. Florida's Coral Reef has an annual estimated tourism value of $1.1 billion and supports 71,000 jobs.\n\nWarming oceans due to climate change are causing increases in heatwaves occurring in the ocean (marine heatwaves). The frequency of these marine heatwaves has doubled since 1982, increasing coral bleaching and destruction. Already over 50% of coral reefs have been lost. If yearly CO2 emissions aren't reduced, in the future these heatwaves will occur 50 times more often than they do today, causing over 97% of all coral reefs to die off along with much of the coastal marine life they support. The loss of coral reefs makes coastal destinations less attractive to tourists and negatively affects local economies."
