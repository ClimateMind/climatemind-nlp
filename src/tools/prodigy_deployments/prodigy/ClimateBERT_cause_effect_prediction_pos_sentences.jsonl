{"text": "This relationship between temperature and violence held even after controlling for numerous alternative explanations, including differences in poverty, unemployment, age distribution, and other sociocultural differences."}
{"text": "To be sure, these other factors can and often do independently affect violent behavior, but they are also likely amplifiers of the effects of climate on aggression (Van de Vliert, 2009).\r\n"}
{"text": "The authors concluded that temperature was associated with violence, particularly in regions plagued with existing conflict and instability."}
{"text": "They found that the hotter annual temperatures yielded significantly higher violent crime rates and, in 96.4% of the years studied, violent crime rates were higher in the summer than the rest of the year (Anderson & DeLisi, 2011).\r\n"}
{"text": "Mechanisms Underlying Temperature-Aggression Effects\r\n"}
{"text": "Given the complexity of almost any human behavior, it makes sense to consider aggression as a product of numerous interacting factors: physiological predispositions, psychological processes, and sociocultural factors."}
{"text": "While a fuller discussion of the different factors underlying aggressive behavior can be found elsewhere (e.g., Anderson & Bushman, 2002), we will briefly review some of the mechanisms thought to underlie the relationship between temperature and aggression.\r\n"}
{"text": "Several biological factors are thought to underlie the link between temperature and aggression."}
{"text": "Others suggest that the human body produces extra adrenaline in response to extreme temperatures, which may in turn facilitate aggression (Simister & Cooper, 2005)."}
{"text": "Others suggest that hot temperatures produce discomfort, increasing irritability and hostile perceptions of others, both of which increase the likelihood of aggression (Anderson & Bushman, 2002; Anderson, 1989)."}
{"text": "Such findings cannot be fully explained through physiological mechanisms and suggest that both biological and psychological factors underlie the relationship between heat and aggression.\r\n"}
{"text": "Taken together, research shows that individuals exposed to hot temperatures are more likely to be violent as a direct result of the heat."}
{"text": "Researchers estimate that even modest increases in average annual temperature (e.g., 1.1\u00b0C) could result in 25,000 more serious and deadly assaults per year in the United States alone (Anderson & DeLisi, 2011; IPCC, 2007).\r\n"}
{"text": "It is unlikely that rapid climate change effects on aggression and violence will be limited to the immediate and direct effect of heat on individuals."}
{"text": "In this next section, we review a growing body of research showing that climate change is also likely to have a multitude of subtler, indirect effects on individuals\u2019 violent behavior, effects that may be even larger in terms of the amount and types of violence engendered.\r\n"}
{"text": "Indirect Effects of Climate Change on Individuals\r\n"}
{"text": "Rapid global climate change will likely affect other variables that, in turn, also increase aggressive behavior in individuals."}
{"text": "Such developmental effects arise because rapid climate change increases exposure of children (and fetuses) to risk factors that are known to lead to violence-prone adults."}
{"text": "Although there are many such indirect pathways to increased violence, we outline four that clearly link rapid climate change to the development of violence-prone adults: food insecurity, economic deprivation, susceptibility to terrorism, and preferential ingroup treatment.\r\n"}
{"text": "Food insecurity brings with it a multitude of problems, and the research reviewed below shows that, among these problems, compromised access to food increases aggression and antisocial behavior.\r\n"}
{"text": "Children who suffered from malnutrition at the age of 3 were more likely than children who were adequately fed to be aggressive and hyperactive at age 8"}
{"text": "childhood aggression, hyperactivity, school problems, conduct disorder) are, themselves, risk factors for adulthood antisocial and violent behavior.\r\n"}
{"text": "Converging evidence for these findings comes from an unfortunate natural experiment that affected 100,000 Dutch men born before and after World War II."}
{"text": "From October 1944 to May 1945, residents living in the western Netherlands were subjected to a German blockade that resulted in significant food insecurity."}
{"text": "In the decades that followed, the men who experienced maternal malnourishment during pregnancy were 2.5 times more likely than men who had not to develop antisocial personality disorder, a condition characterized by frequent violence and antisocial behavior ("}
{"text": "Given that climate change is projected to significantly compromise agricultural production and increase food insecurity for hundreds of millions of people (IPCC, 2007), and given the role that food insecurity plays in the development of violent and antisocial behavior, it is reasonable to expect that climate change\u2019s impact on food accessibility is a risk factor for violence at the individual level."}
{"text": "Moreover, this effect is theoretically distinct from the effect that food shortages also have as a catalyst for intergroup conflict, described later in this chapter.\r\n"}
{"text": "Economic Deprivation\r\nClimate change is projected to have a detrimental impact on economies worldwide, including reduced crop yields, less grazing land, and the loss of homes and jobs due to wildfires and flooding (IPCC, 2007)."}
{"text": "Although the economic impact will likely be felt by most people, the most vulnerable populations are likely to be disproportionately affected, including increased poverty and income disparity (Cullen & Agnew, 2011)."}
{"text": "And although poverty and income disparity are problems in and of themselves, they can also foster decreased life satisfaction, increased resentment, and dissent, all of which are risk factors for retributive aggression (Doherty & Clayton, 2011)."}
{"text": "As noted earlier, one consequence of rapid global warming is an increase in the intensity of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, droughts, and flooding."}
{"text": "When Butler and Gates (2012) studied income disparity in East African cattle herders, they discovered that resource asymmetries caused by extreme and adverse weather contribute to conflict in the region."}
{"text": "This conflict, in turn, is thought to fuel retaliatory attacks, both for vengeance and as a means of dissuading other herders from attacking them in the future."}
{"text": "Of course, actual poverty is not a necessary condition for violence to occur\u2014researchers have shown that significant income disparity is sufficient to yield violent behavior (Barnett & Adger, 2007), particularly if the relative deprivation occurs rapidly (e.g., in the wake of a natural disaster) or if it contributes to uncertainty about one\u2019s own future (Goodhand, 2003; Nafziger & Auvinen, 2002; Ohlsson, 2000).\r\n"}
{"text": "Many of the factors thought to motivate terrorism are byproducts of climate change.\r\n"}
{"text": "For example, one factor that motivates people to pursue terrorism is frustration over the sudden loss of one\u2019s livelihood, particularly when the loss can be attributed to the behavior of others, or when people perceive the loss as disproportionately affecting them, their families, and their larger ingroup (e.g., others are prospering while they suffer; the decisions made by others contributed to their plight)."}
{"text": "Droughts, which are projected to increase in frequency as a result of climate change, bring about many of the conditions that foment terrorism (e.g., threatened livelihood, perceived inability to sustain oneself) and can lead to increased violence in an already violent and vulnerable region."}
{"text": "Illustrating this point, researchers estimate that a one standard deviation increase in drought intensity and duration increases the likelihood of conflict in a region by 62% (Maystadt & Ecker, 2014).\r\n"}
{"text": "The economic effects of climate change are projected to have a number of detrimental effects."}
{"text": "While poverty and starvation are some of the more direct and immediate outcomes, research is beginning to show how climate may have remote effects that include terrorism and militia violence, civil war, and interstate war, illustrating the complexity of climate change effects on humanity and the multitudinous pathways to violent behavior.\r\n"}
{"text": "While terrorism represents a particularly extreme and indirect outcome of climate change, researchers also believe that climate change will lead to more moderate forms of \u201cdefensive\u201d hostility toward others, particularly if they belong to different racial, ethnic, or religious groups."}
{"text": "Climate change is expected to create harsher, more threatening climates (e.g., more frequent and extreme storms, droughts, floods, reduced crop, and livestock yields; IPCC, 2007)."}
{"text": "Such climates threaten both livelihoods and lives, but, as the reviewed research suggests, it will also likely increase violence, particularly toward outgroup members."}
{"text": "Because ongoing rapid climate change in the next century is projected to displace hundreds of millions of people as a result of lost homes and insufficient resources, it is increasingly likely that people will be forced to interact with outgroup member refugees."}
{"text": "This already-volatile situation, combined with the other factors described in this chapter, may well lead to eruptions of violence.\r\n"}
{"text": "In the preceding sections, we have outlined a number of direct and indirect pathways through which climate change may increase the risk of violence in individuals\u2014directly through increased temperature, or indirectly through genetic predispositions, food insecurity, economic deprivation, and defensiveness against outgroups."}
{"text": "Effects of Climate Change on Groups\r\n"}
{"text": "Most of the examples presented involve populations whose livelihood is threatened by deleterious climate change and more frequent and extreme weather patterns."}
{"text": "Such changes can lead to increased economic and political instability and ecomigration\u2014migration of groups ranging from small herding kinship groups to whole nations\u2014as a result of ecological disasters."}
{"text": "Ecomigration further contributes to violent conflict risk through increased competition for dwindling resources, tensions between disparate groups suddenly occupying the same region, distrust regarding each group\u2019s motives, and other socioeconomic issues (Reuveny, 2007)."}
{"text": "Not all ecomigration is the result of rapid climate change, of course (e.g., volcanoes, earthquakes), but ecomigration as the direct result of rapid climate change (e.g., increased frequency and intensity of heat waves, droughts, flooding) is quite common (Piguet, P\u00e9coud, & de Guchteneire, 2011).\r\n"}
{"text": "To demonstrate the impact that climate can have on intergroup conflict, we first present evidence from illustrative case studies in which rapid climate change contributed, in part, to conflict in the region."}
{"text": "We conclude this section by discussing some of the mechanisms underlying or which amplify climate change effects on intragroup and intergroup violence.\r\n"}
{"text": "Many of the case studies presented here result from rapid-onset environmental disasters."}
{"text": "To be sure, not all natural disasters are caused by climate change (e.g., earthquakes, volcanoes)."}
{"text": "However, many environmental disasters are directly influenced by climate change (e.g., flooding due to glacial melting, droughts due to shifting precipitation patterns, increased hurricane frequency and intensity; IPCC, 2007)."}
{"text": "However, to argue that climate change is a risk factor for violence, it is not necessary for climate change to be the largest or even the most immediate contributing factor to the violence in a region."}
{"text": "In many of these cases, an environmental disaster was a flashpoint which ultimately culminated in interpersonal violence due to lost infrastructure, fear and uncertainty, perceived scarcity or competition, or massive relocation\u2014"}
{"text": "For example, significant changes in rainfall patterns and frequent droughts in Kenya, Sudan, and southern Ethiopia threatened the livelihood of pastoralists in these particularly arid regions (Boko et al., 2007), sparking violent conflict as herders were forced to share dwindling water sources and pastures (Leff, 2009)."}
{"text": "In Uganda, droughts in cattle-producing regions led to food costs soaring by more than 200% (IFRCRCS, 2006) and forced more than 1.5 million to move due to violent internal strife."}
{"text": "Together, these examples illustrate the tensions that can arise, both within groups and between groups, when environmental conditions destroy vital resources.\r\n"}
{"text": "For example, one study suggested that for every 1\u00b0C increase in average temperature, civil war frequency across Africa are expected to increase by 5%, even after accounting for social and economic factors (Burke et al., 2009)."}
{"text": "This research incorporated a number of geographical variables, and found that warmer temperatures predict increased violence across the continent."}
{"text": "Models of civil war in sub-Saharan Africa suggest that droughts threaten personal income and livelihood, both of which contribute to the prevalence of civil war (Devitt & Tol, 2012)."}
{"text": "They found that extreme fluctuations in rainfall (droughts and floods) led to political conflict, protests, riots, strikes, intra-governmental violence, coups, violent repression, and anti-government violence."}
{"text": "When looked at as a whole, the research suggests that rapid climate change (and the extreme weather it produces) plays a major role, even if not the largest or most direct, in violent conflicts in Africa.\r\n"}
{"text": "The effect of climate change on conflict is not limited to the African continent, however."}
{"text": "For example, the country of Bangladesh has experienced significant ecomigration due to its rapidly-growing population, unsustainable farming practices, and environmental disasters: more than 25 million have been affected by droughts, 270 million by floods, and 41 million by severe storms."}
{"text": "The result has been a mass migration of 12 to 17 million Bangladeshis into neighboring India since the 1950s, a migration which has led to significant conflict."}
{"text": "In one poignant example, a 5-hour rampage in 1983 led to 1,700 Bengali migrants being killed in India, having been accused of stealing farmland (Homer-Dixon et al., 1993)."}
{"text": "This incident was just one of numerous group conflicts that arose as a result of the disrupted land and economic distribution and the balance of power between religious and ethnic groups in the region (Homer-Dixon, 1994)."}
{"text": "Ecomigration has played a similar role in the Syrian Civil War, after a multi-year drought turned 60% of the country\u2019s land into desert and killed entire herds of cattle."}
{"text": "In both cases, rapid climate changes led to ecomigration which, in turn, contributed to conflict\u2014both between ethnic groups and within the citizens of a single country."}
{"text": "In other regions, the problem is not water scarcity, but land scarcity:"}
{"text": "island countries such as Tuvalu and Kiribati face possible inundation and loss of nationhood due to rising sea levels (Barnett & Adger, 2001; Nurse & Sem, 2001; Perry, 2012; Rahman, 1999; Watson, 2000)."}
{"text": "It has been suggested that by 2080 as much as 70% of the world\u2019s current coastal wetlands could be lost due to rising sea levels (Nicholls et al., 1999), forcing tens or hundreds of millions of people to relocate to other regions.\r\n"}
{"text": "Although the relationship between climate change and conflict is often mediated by ecomigration, this is not always the case."}
{"text": "For example, water scarcity amplified religious and political tensions in the Arab-Israeli wars due to disputed control over the Jordan River basin, which is shared by Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria (Gleick, 1993; see Postel & Wolf, 2001, for additional examples of other important water conflicts).\r\n"}
{"text": "So far, our examples have involved regions suffering from significant political or economic turmoil, and which are already predisposed to violent conflict."}
{"text": "Wealthier, more stable nations are more resilient in the face of climate change effects, but even in such nations there are examples of ecological disasters contributing to conflict."}
{"text": "One example is the U.S. Dust Bowl in the 1930s, where poor farming practices, a prolonged drought, and strong winds caused 2.5 million Americans to lose their livelihoods and leave the Great Plains to adjacent states (Reuveny, 2008)."}
{"text": "Moderating factors (e.g., federal aid) prevented these incidents from becoming full-blown armed conflicts and a civil war, but the impact of these natural disasters nevertheless had a visible impact on violence in these regions, demonstrating that no country is immune to climate-driven effects on aggression.\r\n"}
{"text": "For example, the Little Ice Age\u2014a period of cooling from 1300\u20131850, ushered in a number of significant cultural changes, including shorter growing seasons, changing agricultural practices, and civil war, as disruption in food production led to shortages, famines, and unrest, particularly in agrarian societies lacking the resources to cope with these crises (Fagan, 2000)."}
{"text": "Rapid climate shifts in the past millennium are said to have contributed, in part, to wars across the Northern Hemisphere and in China"}
{"text": "Looking at shorter, predictable changes in inter-annual climate in the past half-century, researchers suggest that as many as 21% of all civil conflicts since 1950 were influenced, in part, by climate conditions (Hsiang et al., 2011).\r\n"}
{"text": "A comprehensive meta-analysis of such studies predicted that a 1 standard deviation increase in global temperatures or extreme rainfall could increase the frequency of interpersonal violence by 4% and intergroup conflict by 14% (Hsiang et al., 2013)."}
{"text": "Although rapid climate change and ensuing ecological disasters may not be the sole or largest factor in determining whether conflict will occur in a region, it is a statistically significant contributor."}
{"text": "In addition to understanding whether climate change affects conflict and violence, scientists have begun to explore whether it is possible to predict when, where, and for whom these effects are likely to be strongest, and to explore some of the mechanisms driving climate change effects on aggression."}
{"text": "While it seems that most places are susceptible to the effects of global climate change on violence, the impact of these effects is more likely to be felt by some groups than others."}
{"text": "While not studied within the context of global warming, there is evidence that, in the aftermath of severe floods, food shortages, and war, when social norms break down, there is an increase in rape, assault, and homicide ("}
{"text": "For example, in the aftermath of a 2009 cyclone that devastated the Sundarbans\u2014an island region bordering India and Bangladesh\u2014many people lost their homes and their jobs."}
{"text": "While natural disasters impact everyone involved, it would be worth pursuing research on particularly vulnerable groups within these populations to better understand the full extent of climate change effects and to understand both the factors that contribute to conflict and violence as well as the impact it has on its victims.\r\n"}
{"text": "Additionally, researchers recognize the importance of understanding the mechanisms underlying violent conflicts that arise due to climate change."}
{"text": "For example, while climate change may cause droughts and other resource shortages, knowing the variables which comprise the causal chain may help policymakers to anticipate and minimize the damage from climate change effects."}
{"text": "For example, one of the important variables in determining whether climate-change-induced resource scarcity will lead to violent conflict is whether a region is already dealing with violence and insecurity (Adano et al., 2012)."}
{"text": "Existing violence reduces people\u2019s resilience by reducing efficient resource use, market stability, and access to education\u2014all factors that would normally make a region resilient to natural disasters."}
{"text": "In a 2015 article, Goodell writes that the United States military faces multi-billion dollar expenses as a direct result of climate change, including the need to upgrade, replace, or relocate naval and air force bases located along vulnerable coastlines or on islands threatened by rising sea levels."}
{"text": "Climate change also indirectly increases military expenditures by increasing the need to prepare for new and more complex deployments (e.g., responding to emergencies such as Hurricane Sandy, climate-related conflicts in regions such as Syria; Department of Defense, 2015), and by increasing the cost of supporting domestic installations (e.g., upgrading port facilities in response to rising sea levels; Department of Defense, 2014)."}
{"text": "As an illustrative example of increased military costs due to climate change: receding Arctic ice cover requires deployment of new naval vessels to address growing tensions between Canada, the United States, Russia, and China over newly-exposed natural resources and shipping lanes (Department of Defense, 2015)."}
{"text": "In this final section, we address criticisms of the position put forth in this chapter that global climate change contributes to increased global conflict and violence."}
{"text": "is not the biggest, or even a practically significant cause of conflict or violence; b) abundance, not scarcity, causes conflict; and c) climate change is neither necessary nor sufficient for violence to occur.\r\n"}
{"text": "The first criticism argues that climate change is not the sole cause of violence and conflict, nor is it even a large enough effect to warrant practical consideration."}
{"text": "These critics often agree that rapid climate change can contribute to violence through resource scarcity and ecomigration."}
{"text": "Similarly, others argue that whether people go to war or seek out peaceful resolutions (be they pastoral cattle herders or countries) is more strongly determined by rational considerations of the cost of war and the value of potential gains from the conflict (Gartzke, 2012), the presence of diplomatic agreements (e.g., Bernauer & Siegfried, 2012), or the availability of technological solutions (e.g., Feitelson et al., 2012)."}
{"text": "We are not proposing that rapid climate change is the only contributing factor to human aggression, or even the most important one."}
{"text": "This position is in line with a report from the Center for Security Studies and swisspeace, which suggested that environmental factors are inextricably intertwined with political, economic, and cultural factors as causes of conflict (Mason et al., 2008)."}
{"text": "This conclusion acknowledges variables that counteract the effects of climate change on violence while still acknowledging that climate change, in and of itself, constitutes both a direct and an indirect risk factor."}
{"text": "This point is made even more apparent in reports suggesting that many of the \u201cbigger\u201d factors are, themselves, caused by or amplified by climate change (CNA, 2007; Department of Defense, 2014), as exemplified by Raleigh and Kniveton (2012), whose research suggests that extreme rainfall variation increases the frequency of violent conflict in East Africa."}
{"text": "To summarize, it is unlikely that future conflicts will be attributed solely to climate change; this does not mean, however, that climate change is not among the distal causes of such conflicts.\r\n"}
{"text": "\u201cAbundance causes conflict, not scarcity\u201d\r\n"}
{"text": "A second criticism leveled against the proposed relationship between climate change and conflict states that in some studies, an abundance\u2014not scarcity\u2014of resources causes conflicts; moreover, these authors claim that, in times of scarcity, people are more willing to cooperate than in times of abundance (e.g., Hendrix, 2010; Hendrix & Glaser, 2007)."}
{"text": "In responding to this position, it should be noted that climate change is expected to bring about both scarcity and abundance of resources, depending on the location."}
{"text": "As such, as has been conceded by some holding these positions (e.g., Hendrix & Salehyan, 2012), conflicts fueled primarily by an abundance of resources do not necessarily detract from the argument that climate change, scarcity, and ecomigration are important risk factors for violence."}
{"text": "Climate change can contribute to the sort of abundances that, in and of themselves, contribute to conflicts."}
{"text": "Furthermore, other data support the claim that both scarcity and abundance can contribute to conflicts (Raleigh & Kniveton, 2012), and that the relationship between resource availability and conflict is likely not a simple one-or-the-other relationship.\r\n"}
{"text": "\u201cRapid climate change is neither a necessary nor sufficient cause of conflict\u201d\r\n"}
{"text": "For example, Reuveny (2007) looked at 38 contemporary examples of environmental migration and found that 19 of them resulted in violent conflict while 19 of them did not."}
{"text": "These data alone \u201cprove\u201d that climate-driven migration is neither necessary nor sufficient to explain conflict."}
{"text": "Instead, they argue that climate is one of many risk factors that contribute to violence and conflict, shifting the debate to one about the magnitude, mechanisms, and moderators of climate change effects as compared to social, political, and economic effects (e.g., Zhang et al., 2007a)."}
{"text": "The bad news is that countries already particularly vulnerable to conflict and aggression, or which are already experiencing significant land degradation, water scarcity, or high population density, are at the greatest risk of experiencing an increase in conflict and violence due to global climate change (Hallegatte et al., 2016; Mares & Moffett, 2015; O\u2019Loughlin et al., 2014; Raleigh et al., 2014; Raleigh & Urdal, 2007; Van de Vliert, 2013)."}
{"text": "Furthermore, even though some countries are better-shielded from famine by protective economic or political factors, even developed countries are likely to see increases in the proportion of children exposed to risk factors for violence, and may find themselves struggling to defend their way of life against worsening climate-driven economic conditions (Van de Vliert, 2013)."}
{"text": "Even within wealthy, highly developed countries, the socially disadvantaged are likely to experience the detrimental effects of climate change, as illustrated by a study of crime data in St. Louis, Missouri, which found that unusually hot temperatures disproportionately increased violent crime in disadvantaged neighborhoods (Mares, 2013)."}
{"text": "Moreover, increased poverty, civil dissolution, and wars in developing countries can have a spreading impact on developed countries, either from an increase in the global need for resources, the involvement of developed countries in wars worldwide, and the breeding of terrorist groups in have-not countries fueled by resentment toward primarily Western countries (e.g., Doherty & Clayton, 2011)."}
{"text": "And while some may argue that technological breakthroughs will ameliorate some of these effects, existing technology, including air conditioning in cars and buildings, water desalination techniques, and better irrigation systems often consume power themselves, which only further contributes to greenhouse gases and the problem of climate change.\r\n"}
{"text": "Such actions include reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which reduces the speed and magnitude of climate change, and the use of better population control (given that most of the increase in population in the next decade is expected to take place in developing countries, with huge increases in greenhouse gas emissions as a result)."}

{"text": "With recent studies emphasizing the particular role of temperature in explaining past spatial and temporal variation in agricultural yields and economic output in Africa (10, 11), it thus appears plausible that temperature fluctuations could affect past and future conflict risk, but few studies have explicitly considered the role of temperature."}

{"text": "Consistent with previous studies (2, 7), and to capture the potentially delayed response of conflict to climate-induced economic shocks (due to, e.g., the elapsed time between climate events and the harvest period), we allow both contemporaneous and lagged climate variables to affect conflict risk.\r\n"}
{"text": "Temperature variables are strongly related to conflict incidence over our historical panel, with a 1 \u00b0C increase in temperature in our preferred specification leading to a 4.5% increase in civil war in the same year and a 0.9% increase in conflict incidence in the next year (model 1 in Table 1)."}

{"text": "To predict changes in the incidence of civil war under future climate change, we combine our estimated historical response of conflict to climate with climate projections from 20 general circulation models that have contributed to the World Climate Research Program's Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 (WCRP CMIP3)."}
{"text": "We focus on climate changes and associated changes in conflict risk to the year 2030, both because the host of factors beyond climate that contribute to conflict risk (e.g., economic performance, political institutions) are more likely to remain near-constant over the next few decades relative to mid-century or end of century, and because climate projections themselves are relatively insensitive to alternate greenhouse gas emissions scenarios to 2030.\r\n"}
{"text": "Again given the 11% of country-years in our panel that experience conflict, this increase corresponds to a 54% rise in the average likelihood of conflict across the continent (Table 2)."}
{"text": "If future conflicts are on average as deadly as conflicts during our study period, and assuming linear increases in temperature to 2030, this warming-induced increase in conflict risk would result in a cumulative additional 393,000 battle deaths by 2030 (see Methods)."}
{"text": "Given that total loss of life related to conflict events can be many times higher than direct battle deaths (18), the human costs of this conflict increase likely would be much higher.\r\n"}
{"text": "Because uncertainty in projections of conflict incidence appear driven more by the uncertainty in the climate\u2013conflict relationship than by climate model projections (Fig."}
{"text": "Estimates of the median and range of projected increases in conflict remain remarkably consistent across specifications of how civil war responds to climate (Fig. 2, Top), including whether war is assumed to respond to levels of climate variables or year-to-year changes in those variables, whether or not potential response to precipitation in addition to temperature is included, and the use of alternative climate data sets."}

{"text": "We find that neither is able to overcome the large effects of temperature increase on civil war incidence, although the optimistic scenario reduces the risk of civil war by roughly 2% relative to the linear extrapolation, corresponding to a 20% relative decline in conflict (Fig. 2, Bottom).\r\n"}
{"text": "The large effect of temperature relative to precipitation is perhaps surprising given the important role that precipitation plays in rural African livelihoods and previous work emphasizing the impact of falling precipitation on conflict risk (2)."}
{"text": "In fact, precipitation and temperature fluctuations are negatively correlated (r = \u22120.34) over our study period, suggesting that earlier findings of increased conflict during drier years might have been partly capturing the effect of hotter years."}
{"text": "Nevertheless, the temperature signal is robust across datasets and is consistent with a growing body of evidence demonstrating the direct negative effects of higher temperatures on agricultural productivity and the importance of these fluctuations for economic performance (10, 11, 19).\r\n"}
{"text": "Temperature can affect agricultural yields both through increases in crop evapotranspiration (and hence heightened water stress in the absence of irrigation) and through accelerated crop development, with the combined effect of these 2 mechanisms often reducing African staple crop yields by 10%\u201330% per \u00b0C of warming (3, 11, 20)."}
{"text": "Because the vast majority of poor African households are rural, and because the poorest of these typically derive between 60% and 100% of their income from agricultural activities (21), such temperature-related yield declines can have serious economic consequences for both agricultural households and entire societies that depend heavily on agriculture (10)."}
{"text": "Finally, because economic welfare is the single factor most consistently associated with conflict incidence in both cross-country and within-country studies (1, 2, 14\u201316), it appears likely that the variation in agricultural performance is the central mechanism linking warming to conflict in Africa."}
{"text": "Yet because our study cannot definitively rule out other plausible contributing factors\u2014for instance, violent crime, which has been found to increase with higher temperatures (22), and nonfarm labor productivity, which can decline with higher temperatures (23)\u2014further elucidating the relative contributions of these factors remains a critical area for future research.\r\n"}
{"text": "When combined with the unanimous projections of near-term warming across climate models and climate scenarios, this temperature effect provides a coherent and alarming picture of increases in conflict risk under climate change over the next 2 decades in Africa."}
{"text": "Furthermore, the adverse impact of warming on conflict by 2030 appears likely to outweigh any potentially offsetting effects of strong economic growth and continued democratization."}
{"text": "We view this final result with some caution, however, because economic and political variables are clearly endogenous to conflict; for example, conflict may both respond to and cause variation in economic performance (2) or democratization."}
{"text": "Consequently, credibly identifying past or future contributions of economic growth or democratization to civil war risk is difficult."}
{"text": "We interpret our result as evidence of the strength of the temperature effect rather than as documentation of the precise future contribution of economic progress or democratization to conflict risk."}
{"text": "The possibility of large warming-induced increases in the incidence of civil war has a number of public policy implications."}
{"text": "First, if temperature is primarily affecting conflict via shocks to economic productivity, then, given the current and expected future importance of agriculture in African livelihoods (24), governments and aid donors could help reduce conflict risk in Africa by improving the ability of African agriculture to deal with extreme heat."}

{"text": "Cancer Risks from Hazardous Air Pollutants\r\n"}
{"text": "Our variable for assessing risks from exposure to chronic pollution is cumulative cancer risk from HAPs emitted by all ambient emission sources."}
{"text": "HAPs include 187 specific substances identified in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 that are known to or suspected of causing cancer and other serious health problems (EPA 2016)."}
{"text": "To measure cancer risks from chronic exposure to HAPs, we use data from the US EPA\u2019s 2011 National Air Toxics Assessment (NATA), which was released in 2015 (EPA 2016)."}
{"text": "The NATA is an important tool for estimating health risks associated with chronic exposure to various sources of HAPs, and a reliable data source for EJ research on air pollution (Collins et al. 2015a, 2015b).\r\n"}
{"text": "The 2011 NATA estimates potential cumulative risks to public health from HAP exposure following the EPA\u2019s risk characterization guidelines that assume a lifelong exposure to 2011 levels of air emissions."}
{"text": "These risk estimates are considered to be upper-bound estimates of the probability that an individual will contract cancer over a 70-year lifetime as a result of exposure to HAPs."}
{"text": "This would be an excess cancer risk in addition to other cancer risks borne by a person not exposed to these HAPs.\r\n"}
{"text": "Estimates of cumulative lifetime cancer risk (persons per million) include risks associated with inhalation exposure to HAPs released by major stationary sources (e.g., large waste incinerators, factories), smaller stationary sources (e.g., dry cleaners, small manufacturers), on-road mobile sources (e.g., cars, trucks), nonroad mobile sources (e.g., airplanes, trains, lawn mowers, construction vehicles), and background concentrations (i.e., contributions from distant or natural sources)."}

{"text": "In the first GEE (Table 3), the same-sex partner household enclave indicator exhibits a positive and statistically significant relationship with cancer risk from HAPs, and the standardized coefficient (0.105) is the second largest among the independent variables, meaning it is a relatively strong predictor of HAP cancer risk."}
{"text": "In the second GEE (Table 4), the same-sex male partner household enclave variable has a positive and significant association with risk, while the indicator for same-sex female partner household enclaves shows a negative and non-significant (p=0.170) relationship with cancer risk from HAPs."}
{"text": "Both race/ethnicity variables show positive and significant relationships with cancer risk from HAPs."}
{"text": "This result suggests a quadratic association between median household income and cumulative cancer risk from HAPs.\r\n"}
{"text": "With respect to our research questions, findings from the GEE analysis demonstrate that cancer risks from HAPs in Greater Houston are distributed inequitably with respect to the neighborhood-level composition of same-sex partner households, adjusting for geographic clustering as well as a suite of variables known to influence air pollution risk."}
{"text": "First, our understanding of the historical-geography of Greater Houston points toward the post-WWII clustering of LGBT people within highly polluted Inner Loop neighborhoods\u2014due to heteronormative marginalization and the pursuit of community support and empowerment\u2014as the primary factor shaping environmental injustices experienced by same-sex couples circa 2010."}
{"text": "Second, any shifts toward heteronormative acceptance of alternative sexualities, societal assimilation, and spatial decentralization of LGBT residence over the past fifteen years (Spring 2013) have apparently not ameliorated the sexualized patterning of environmental injustice in Greater Houston."}
{"text": "In any case, environmental injustices based on sexual orientation produced in Greater Houston during the latter half of the 20th century have evidently not been ameliorated over the past fifteen years."}
{"text": "It remains unclear based on our cross-sectional analysis results, however, whether the pattern of disproportionate exposure to cancer-causing HAPs has become less pronounced as a result of LGBT population dispersal.\r\n"}
{"text": "Third, the sexualities and space literature as well as our understanding of the historical geography of Greater Houston suggest that the clustering of gay male couples within polluted Inner Loop neighborhoods, in comparison to the more dispersed pattern of residence for lesbian couples across metropolitan space, is the primary reason for the gendered distribution of cancer risk from HAPs experienced among same-sex couples today."}
{"text": "It remains an open question as to whether this is attributable to gender-specific push factors, such as the privileging of masculine ideals and the disempowerment of female homosexuality, the greater likelihood for lesbian couples to have children and thus seek more child-friendly neighborhoods away from the inner-city, and/or the economic exclusion of lesbian couples (who tend to be of lower socioeconomic status compared to gay men) via escalating housing costs from gentrifying Inner Loop neighborhoods (e.g., Montrose)."}
{"text": "Fourth, in terms of the control variables, we found that non-Hispanic Blacks, Hispanics, and renter-occupants are significantly more likely to reside in neighborhoods with cancer risk from HAPs, which is consistent with previous studies of HAP cancer risks in Greater Houston (Collins 2015a; Chakraborty et al. 2014)."}
{"text": "While the bivariate correlation suggests a significant and negative association between median household income and risk exposure, it ceases to remain linear when we account for the effects of other variables and geographic clustering."}
{"text": "(2014), this suggests that lower income tracts include fewer land use activities (e.g., commercial, industrial, or transportation) that emit HAPs, and, conversely, that higher income tracts include residents with capacities to avoid and/or resist land use activities that generate HAPs."}
{"text": "Thus, while not the focus of our study, these findings contribute to the mounting evidence regarding environmental injustices in Greater Houston based on race-, ethnicity- and class-based oppression.\r\n"}
{"text": "The NATA includes risks from only direct inhalation of HAPs and excludes exposure from other pathways such as ingestion or skin contact."}
{"text": "Additionally, interpretation of the public health implications of the disproportionate cancer risks from HAPs quantified here should be tempered, since the NATA offers a cumulative lifetime exposure measure, yet we know that people do not remain in their 2010 census tracts of residence throughout their lifetimes."}
{"text": "Since the NATA data inadequately characterize the range of environmental contexts that influence people\u2019s exposures to HAPs, reliance on this dataset in EJ research is bound to generate inferences regarding disproportionate exposures that are confounded by the uncertain geographic context problem (UGCoP; Kwan 2012)."}
{"text": "Additionally, future research should take into account the effects of legalization of civil partnership and gay marriage in some jurisdictions upon the patterning of harmful environmental exposures by sexual orientation.\r\n"}
{"text": "Our quantitative analysis results cannot be used to deduce the sequence of events that led to increased pollution exposures in specific neighborhoods that contain relatively high concentrations of same-sex partner households."}

{"text": "Our findings suggest that those health risks experienced in gay neighborhoods may be compounded by disparate health risks associated with harmful exposures to air toxics."}

{"text": "While acute time-limited stressors, such as mental arithmetic or public speaking can enhance immune parameters, particularly those associated with innate immunity, longer term stressor exposure tends to depress cell-mediated immunity (Th1), upregulate Th2-associated cytokines and antibodies to latent viruses (e.g., EBV), and depress innate immunity (reviewed in [29]).\r\n"}
{"text": "Parent-reported perceived stress and depressive symptoms [56] and a harsh family climate [57] were associated with a pro-inflammatory profile in children and adolescents (respectively), while higher perceived self-efficacy in children aged 7\u201310 years was associated with an anti-inflammatory profile, i.e., lower IL-6 concentrations [58]."}

{"text": "Psychological Stress as a Mediator of Climate Change Induced Immune Dysfunction\r\n"}
{"text": "Following extreme weather events, where numerous stressors may already be affecting immune function (e.g., overcrowding, exposure to temperature extremes, sleep disturbance), prolonged psychological stress can further modulate the immune response."}
{"text": "For example, 33% of Florida residents affected by Hurricane Andrew suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the first four months (76% had at least on symptom of PTSD), and this was associated with lower natural killer cell activity, a marker of innate immune function [80]."}

{"text": "Overall, the effect of exposure to UVR is one of down-regulation of cell mediated (Th1) processes and promotion of a regulatory environment within draining lymph nodes.\r\n"}
{"text": "Animal model and human clinical studies have also shown an association between UV irradiation and increased incidence of skin tumours and infection."}
{"text": "In animal models, UV irradiation has resulted in reduced immune responses following infection with a range of pathogens, including: Listeria monocytogenes, Mycobacterium leprae, Mycobacterium bovis (BCG), Trichinella spiralis, Leishmania, Borrelia burgdorferi, Plasmodium chabaudi and Candida albicans [89,90]."}
{"text": "In humans, reactivation of herpes simplex virus (HSV) and human papilloma virus (HPV) infections appear to be related to UVR exposure, through viral-tropism and immunosuppression [91].\r\n"}
{"text": "There is evidence, albeit limited, suggesting that increased UVR exposure can cause decreased vaccine effectiveness [92]."}
{"text": "Significant suppression of cell mediated and humoralimmunity occurred following experimental UVB exposure in mice recently vaccinated with hepatitis B [93]."}
{"text": "Cell mediated immune suppression (as measured by contact hypersensitivity reactions) was suppressed in similar experiments on healthy human subjects, though notably, there was no clinically significant reduction in the measured antibody response [94]."}
{"text": "There was however, significant variation in immune response following UVR exposure dependent on specific cytokine gene polymorphisms [95].\r\n"}
{"text": "Studies have shown decreasing prevalence of autoimmune diseases (such as Type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis and connective tissue disorders) associated with higher levels of surrogate markers of solar UVR exposure [100,101]."}
{"text": "This has been represented as further evidence of the influence of UVR exposure on suppressing cell-mediated responses, directly or indirectly via vitamin D-mediated mechanisms [102].\r\n"}
{"text": "Global climate change is expected to influence future personal UVR exposure via altered atmospheric conditions and changing behavioural, clothing and outdoor activity patterns."}
{"text": "Though heavy cloud cover will likely diminish the amount of UVR reaching Earth\u2019s surface, partly cloudy skies can lead to large enhancements due to the effect of scattering [105]."}
{"text": "Taking into account cloud cover changes, recent modelling predicts a decrease in ambient erythemal UV radiation of 10% at northern high latitudes and an increase of 3%\u20136% at low latitudes [106].\r\n"}
{"text": "A more significant impact on personal UVR dose may arise through changes in behaviour and clothing patterns."}
{"text": "Ultraviolet Radiation as a Mediator of Climate Change-Induced Immune Dysfunction\r\n"}
{"text": "The likely overall effects of climate change on predicted levels of UVR at Earth\u2019s surface are for an increase in current latitudinal gradients\u2014i.e., higher levels at low latitudes where they are already high, and lower levels at high northern latitudes where they are already low [106]."}
{"text": "In many parts of the world, particularly in temperate zones, we postulate that personal UVR exposure will increase due to increased outdoor activity and less clothing coverage due to warmer weather."}
{"text": "This may have beneficial effects, for example in decreasing incidence rates of Th1-mediated autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis, if a causal association truly exists with UVR dose."}
{"text": "Improved vitamin D status (consequent upon higher UVR dose) may also benefit bone and muscle health, possibly reducing risk of certain cancers [111], cardiovascular, rheumatic and other disorders [112].\r\n"}
{"text": "However, there is considerable potential for adverse effects caused by excessive UVR dose, particularly in developing countries."}
{"text": "Higher levels of ambient UVR and temperature may individually or in combination impair the immune response to vaccination and increase risk of infections."}
{"text": "For example, a risk assessment study estimated that exposure to just 90 min of midday, mid-latitude sunshine in the summer months in sensitive, non-adapted individuals, would lead to a 50% reduction in specific cell-mediated immune responses to Listeria monocytogenes, an intra-cellular bacterium [113]."}
{"text": "Outbreaks of measles infection amongst previously vaccinated children in north India has also been tentatively linked to excessive UVR exposure [99].\r\n"}
{"text": "Here we have focused on undernutrition, psychological stress, and ultraviolet radiation as possible mediators of the effect of climate change on immune-related health risks in childhood."}
{"text": "Though the magnitude of deterioration in immune function for any given climate change-sensitive variable may be small, their combined effects on whole populations may lead to significant protective clinical thresholds being breached."}
{"text": "Demonstration of a causal link between climate change and health outcomes is enormously challenging."}

{"text": "Abstract\r\nIce loss from the world\u2019s glaciers and ice sheets contributes to sea level rise, influences ocean circulation, and affects ecosystem productivity."}
{"text": "Ongoing changes in glaciers and ice sheets are driven by submarine melting and iceberg calving from tidewater glacier margins."}
{"text": "The observed melt rates are up to two orders of magnitude greater than predicted by theory, challenging current simulations of ice loss from tidewater glaciers.\r\n"}
{"text": "Because of strong glacier dynamic feedbacks, tidewater glaciers can undergo advance and retreat cycles independent of climate forcing (7) with associated changes in iceberg calving fluxes, subglacial discharge, and submarine melting (8)."}
{"text": "The need for observational constraints on submarine melting of tidewater glaciers is pressing, as ice loss is accelerating from Antarctica (11, 12), Greenland (13, 14), and mountain glaciers around the globe (15)."}
{"text": "High-latitude glacier environments continue to experience accelerated warming from both the oceans (16) and the atmosphere (13)."}
{"text": "Submarine melting enhances subaerial iceberg calving; if submarine melt rates vary vertically because of a dependence on ocean density stratification, ocean temperature, and subglacial discharge, then enhanced calving can extend below the waterline at glacier termini, indirectly affecting glacier stability and the dynamic mass loss of ice sheets (18).\r\n"}
{"text": "Constraints on basal melting from Antarctic ice shelves come from satellite measurements (12) and from sensors deployed directly on top of ice shelves (19) or in the sub\u2013ice shelf ocean through boreholes drilled through the ice (10)."}
{"text": "Instead, most recent studies examining ice\u2013ocean interactions have focused on the subglacial discharge plume, which is driven by glacier runoff that penetrates to depth and exits at the grounding line before upwelling buoyantly along the ice face (9, 20)."}
{"text": "However, several recent studies suggest that ambient melt rates must be higher than predicted and up to the same order of magnitude as discharge-driven melt (23, 25, 26)."}
{"text": "These melt rates imply that, on average, ~22% of the ice flux in August is accounted for by submarine melting (the rest is lost by calving), whereas only 8% of the ice flux in May is attributed to melt."}
{"text": "By contrast, previous flux-gate\u2013derived values may be biased high because they include iceberg melt and the surveys tend to occur during daytime, when discharge and melting are above average.\r\n"}
{"text": "These direct estimates of submarine melt are much higher than ambient melt estimates calculated with existing theory (29), which range from 0.02 to 0.07 m day\u22121 in August and 0.01 to 0.07 m day\u22121 in May (Fig. 3 and fig."}
{"text": "Additionally, theory predicts large differences in melt rates (two orders of magnitude) between discharge-driven melt and ambient melting, but the observations show high melt rates of similar magnitude across the entire terminus."}
{"text": "Thus, parameterizations developed from plume theory would lead to inaccurate subsurface morphology changes (i.e., overcutting or undercutting) and unrealistic differences in melt rates between regions of ambient melting and discharge-driven melting.\r\n"}
{"text": "These melt rates come from dividing the calculated meltwater flux by the total subsurface ice front area and include iceberg melt."}
{"text": "Generally, the flux-gate results have closer correspondence with the multibeam-derived measurements compared with plume theory\u2013derived values during periods of strong discharge, suggesting that ocean measurements are a viable way to infer total freshwater influx from the glacier (table S4) when (i)"}
{"text": "The observed melting patterns show a changing terminus shape over the seasons that does not follow from present-day melt parameterizations (32, 33)."}
{"text": "If submarine melting does indeed influence iceberg calving and the subsequent glacier dynamic response (18), then accurately predicting where in space and time melting occurs is critical."}
{"text": "Submarine melting does not appear to be a simple function of temperature and subglacial discharge but may also vary with the vigor of other near-terminus circulation patterns (25)."}
{"text": "The processes that enhance near-terminus circulation are either directly related to the glacier terminus itself (30) (e.g., iceberg calving, plume discharge) or by other fjord processes (e.g., tidal currents, internal waves), suggesting that complex feedbacks exist that are completely absent from current simulations of submarine glacier mass loss.\r\n"}

{"text": "Abstract\r\nTwo global coupled climate models show that even if the concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere had been stabilized in the year 2000, we are already committed to further global warming of about another half degree and an additional 320% sea level rise caused by thermal expansion by the end of the 21st century."}
{"text": "Projected weakening of the meridional overturning circulation in the North Atlantic Ocean does not lead to a net cooling in Europe."}
{"text": "Increases of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere produce a positive radiative forcing of the climate system and a consequent warming of surface temperatures and rising sea level caused by thermal expansion of the warmer seawater, in addition to the contribution from melting glaciers and ice sheets (1, 2)."}
{"text": "We performed multimember ensemble simulations with two global coupled three-dimensional climate models to quantify how much more global warming and sea level rise (from thermal expansion) we could experience under several different scenarios.\r\n"}
{"text": "This model has a relatively low climate sensitivity as compared to other models, with an equilibrium climate sensitivity of 2.1\u00b0C and a transient climate response (TCR) (the globally averaged surface air temperature change at the time of CO2 doubling in a 1% CO2 increase experiment) of 1.3\u00b0C."}
{"text": "The 20th-century simulations for both models include time-evolving changes in forcing from solar, volcanoes, GHGs, tropospheric and stratospheric ozone, and the direct effect of sulfate aerosols (14, 17)."}
{"text": "These 20th-century forcing differences between CCSM3 and PCM are not thought to cause large differences in response in the climate change simulations beyond the year 2000.\r\n"}
{"text": "The warming in both the PCM and CCSM3 is close to the observed value of about 0.6\u00b0C for the 20th century (19), with PCM warming 0.6\u00b0C and CCSM3 warming 0.7"}
{"text": "This lower value from the models is consistent with the part of 20th-century sea level rise thought to be caused by thermal expansion (20, 21), because as the ocean warms, seawater expands and sea level rises."}
{"text": "Neither model includes contributions to sea level rise due to ice sheet or glacier melting."}
{"text": "Contributions from future ice sheet and glacier melting could perhaps at least double the projected sea level rise produced by thermal expansion (1).\r\n"}
{"text": "Even if we could have stopped any further increases in all atmospheric constituents as of the year 2000, the PCM and CCSM3 indicate that we are already committed to 0.4\u00b0 and 0.6\u00b0C, respectively, more global warming by the year 2100 as compared to the 0.6\u00b0C of warming observed at the end of the 20th century (Table 1 and Fig."}

{"text": "If concentrations of all GHGs and other atmospheric constituents in these simulations are held fixed at year 2100 values, we would be committed to an additional warming by the year 2200 for B1 of about 0.1\u00b0 to 0.3\u00b0C for the models (Fig. 1B)."}
{"text": "But even for this small warming commitment in B1, there is almost double the sea level rise seen over the course of the 21st century by 2200, or an additional 12 and 13 cm (Fig. 1C)."}

{"text": "The mean strength of the meridional overturning and its changes are an indication of ocean ventilation, and they contribute to ocean heat uptake and consequent time scales of temperature response in the climate system (12, 24, 28).\r\n"}
{"text": "This is consistent with the idea that a larger percentage decrease in meridional overturning would be associated with greater ocean heat uptake and greater surface temperature warming (12, 24).\r\n"}
{"text": "This is also consistent with the recovery of the meridional overturning in the 21st century after concentrations are stabilized in the PCM (net recovery of 0.2 sverdrups) compared to the CCSM3 (meridional + overturning continues to weaken by \u20130.3 sverdrups before a modest recovery).\r\n"}
{"text": "On the other hand, the CCSM3, with higher sensitivity and weaker mean meridional overturning, has a larger reduction of meridional overturning due to global warming (and particularly a larger percent decrease of meridional overturning) than the PCM and contributes to more warming commitment for GHG concentrations stabilized at year 2000 values.\r\n"}
{"text": "The processes that contribute to these different warming commitments involve small radiative flux imbalances at the surface (on the order of several tenths of a watt per square meter) after atmospheric GHG concentrations are stabilized."}
{"text": "The temperature difference between the upper and lower branches of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation is smaller in the PCM than in the CCSM3 because of the stronger rate of mean meridional overturning in the PCM that induces a greater heat exchange or ventilation between the upper and deeper ocean."}
{"text": "Geographic patterns of warming (Fig. 2) show more warming at high northern latitudes and over land, generally larger-amplitude warming in the CCSM3 as compared to the PCM, and geographic temperature increases roughly proportional to the amplitude of the globally averaged temperature increases in the different scenarios (Fig. 1B)."}
{"text": "Slowdowns in meridional overturning in the respective models (which are greater percentage-wise in the CCSM3 than the PCM) are not characterized by less warming over northern Europe in either model."}
{"text": "The warming produced by increases in GHGs overwhelms any tendency toward decreased high-latitude warming from less northward heat transport by the weakened meridional overturning circulation in the Atlantic."}
{"text": "The warming commitment from the 20th-century stabilization experiments (Fig. 2, bottom) shows the same type of pattern in the forced experiments, with greater warming over high latitudes and land areas."}
{"text": "For regions such as much of North America, even after stabilizing GHG concentrations, we are already committed to more than an additional half a degree of warming in the two models."}
{"text": "Though temperature increase shows signs of leveling off 100 years after stabilization, sea level continues to rise unabated with proportionately much greater increases compared to temperature, with these committed increases over the 21st century more than a factor of 3 greater, percentage-wise, for sea level rise (32) than for temperature change (Fig. 3)."}

{"text": "Consistent with our scientific understanding, the largest increases in temperature are occurring closer to the poles, especially in the Arctic."}

{"text": "While there is a clear long-term global warming trend, some years do not show a temperature increase relative to the previous year, and some years show greater changes than others."}

{"text": "Natural drivers of climate cannot explain the recent observed warming."}
{"text": "Over the last five decades, natural factors (solar forcing and volcanoes) alone would actually have led to a slight cooling (see Figure 2.3).\r\n"}
{"text": "The majority of the warming at the global scale over the past 50 years can only be explained by the effects of human influences,,, especially the emissions from burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) and from deforestation."}
{"text": "The emissions from human influences that are affecting climate include heat-trapping gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane, and nitrous oxide, and particles such as black carbon (soot), which has a warming influence, and sulfates, which have an overall cooling influence (see Appendix 3:"}

{"text": "Climate changes since 1950 cannot be explained by natural factors or variability, and can only be explained by human factors."}

{"text": "Globally, natural variations can be as large as human-induced climate change over timescales of up to a few decades."}
{"text": "However, changes in climate at the global scale observed over the past 50 years are far larger than can be accounted for by natural variability."}

{"text": "This is not in conflict with our basic understanding of global warming and its primary cause."}
{"text": "This time period is too short to signify a change in the warming trend, as climate trends are measured over periods of decades, not years."}
{"text": ",,,, Such decade-long slowdowns or even reversals in trend have occurred before in the global instrumental record (for example, 1900-1910 and 1940-1950; see Figure 2.2), including three decade-long periods since 1970, each followed by a sharp temperature rise."}
{"text": "Second, a series of mildly explosive volcanoes, which increased stratospheric particles, likely had more of a cooling effect than previously recognized."}
{"text": ",, Third, the high incidence of La Ni\u00f1a events in the last 15 years has played a role in the observed trends."}
{"text": ", Recent analyses suggest that more of the increase in heat energy during this period has been transferred to the deep ocean than previously."}
{"text": "While this might temporarily slow the rate of increase in surface air temperature, ultimately it will prolong the effects of global warming because the oceans hold heat for longer than the atmosphere does.\r\n"}
{"text": "Therefore, it is not surprising that the timing of such a slowdown in the rate of increase in the models would be different than that observed, although it is important to note that such periods have been simulated by climate models, with the deep oceans absorbing the extra heat during those decades.\r\n"}

{"text": "How climate change affects wildfires\r\n"}
{"text": "Climate change contributes to more and bigger wildfires in a variety of ways.\r\n"}
{"text": "The rise in average global temperatures has led to higher spring and summer temperatures, and importantly an earlier onset of spring."}
{"text": "This pattern has led to a rapid melting of spring snowpack, causing soils to dry out earlier and remain dry longer.\r\n"}

{"text": "In California, the level of tree mortality has been so high in some areas that 70 percent of trees died in a single year.\r\n"}
{"text": "Meanwhile, the West Coast of the U.S. is particularly susceptible to a kind of weather whiplash \u2013 wet winters fueled by atmospheric river storms originating in the Eastern Pacific, followed by parched summers that dry out spring vegetation and transform it into kindling for wildfires in the fall."}
{"text": "A 2018 study in Nature Climate Change projected a 25 percent to 100 percent increase in extreme dry-to-wet precipitation events.\r\n"}
{"text": "How wildfires affect health\r\n"}
{"text": "As wildfires grow in frequency, intensity, and the amount of area burned, they pose serious health risks.\r\n"}
{"text": "Smoke from wildfires contains volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides that form ozone and organic particulates and other toxic pollutants \u2013 all of which can be dangerous and even deadly for sensitive populations."}
{"text": "Wildfires also impact climate change because they emit massive amounts of carbon dioxide and other pollutants that can affect regional and even global climate.\r\n"}
{"text": "Wildfires are also expected to increase the risk for destructive mudslides, as landscapes laid bare by fire are drenched with winter rain."}
{"text": "For example, mudslides in the Santa Barbara area in early 2018, coming after wildfires in the fall of 2017, devastated the region.\r\n"}
{"text": "Although the frequency of wildfires overall is very likely to increase as temperatures warm, where and when they\u2019ll spark is difficult to impossible to predict."}
{"text": "How warming affects the growth of trees is also uncertain, as are warming effects on the distribution and abundance of various species.\r\n"}
{"text": "What can be done to reduce wildfires?\r\n"}

{"text": "1 Introduction\r\nSeasonal snowpack acts as an important natural reservoir, reducing the likelihood of winter floods and providing water in the spring and summer when demand exceeds supply from precipitation (Barnett et al., 2005; Gleick, 1987)."}

{"text": "A shift from snow to rain thus carries potential consequences for water resources (Berghuijs et al., 2014) and flood risk (Huang et al., 2018).\r\n"}
{"text": "Rainfall and snowmelt are both important mechanisms for flood generation in mountainous or snow\u2010dominated regions"}
{"text": "As a result, accounting for both snowmelt and precipitation intensity is essential for accurately predicting flood size (Harpold & Kohler, 2017;"}
{"text": "There is evidence that warmer conditions have already initiated a shift towards more rain\u2010dominated flood regimes (Huang et al., 2018), with snowmelt occurring earlier in the year (Bl\u00f6schl et al., 2017; Dettinger et al., 2004; Hall et al., 2014; Hamlet et al., 2006; Stewart et al., 2005), and many watersheds seeing an increased number of annual peak floods caused by rainfall (Fritze et al., 2011; Kampf & Lefsky, 2016)."}
{"text": "events, which are associated with some of the largest floods in snow\u2010dominated regions (Harr, 1981; Kattelmann, 1997; Sui & Koehler, 2001), are becoming more frequent at high elevations and less frequent at low elevations, with this pattern expected to continue in the future (Freudiger et al."}
{"text": "Likewise, in the Sierra Nevada and Cascades, intense precipitation has historically been warmer than less\u2010intense precipitation (suggesting that wet extremes could have greater potential to transition to liquid precipitation) but may also be warming at a slower rate (Rupp & Li, 2017).\r\n"}
{"text": "Despite evidence of transitions toward more rain\u2010dominated flooding, previous studies have generally found a lack of significant trends in flood magnitude (Archfield et al., 2016; Hodgkins et al., 2017; Lins & Slack, 1999; Slater & Villarini, 2016)."}
{"text": "Similarly, there have been very few significant trends in runoff efficiency at the annual scale (McCabe et al., 2018), despite robust decreases in annual snow fraction and evidence that lower snow fractions can lead to reduced runoff efficiency (Berghuijs et al., 2014)."}
{"text": "The lack of significant trends highlights difficulties in understanding impacts of warming on streamflow, in part because a long time series (>100 years) is often necessary to detect robust changes in streamflow (Wilby, 2006; Ziegler et al., 2005)."}
{"text": "Historical warming has likely increased flood magnitude for mixed\u2010regime watersheds (Hamlet & Lettenmaier, 2007), with similar increases in flood risk projected in the future"}
{"text": "Overall, the existing literature suggests some heterogeneity in the watershed\u2010scale response to global warming, with changes in flood magnitude not yet detectable for most watersheds.\r\n"}
{"text": "A shift from snow to rain could affect the size of floods through a number of mechanisms."}
{"text": "For example, lower snowmelt intensity is projected under warmer conditions (Musselman et al., 2017), which could lead to smaller snowmelt\u2010driven floods."}
{"text": "With a higher elevation of freezing, there is a larger contributing area for runoff production and the potential for much larger flood events from rain (Kattelmann, 1997;"}
{"text": "Whether rainfall\u2010driven floods could become larger than historical snowmelt\u2010driven floods also depends on whether future rain rates could exceed historical snowmelt rates."}
{"text": "Recent climate modeling evidence suggests that warming\u2010induced decreases in snow\u2010to\u2010rain ratio lead to increased flood risk (Huang et al."}

{"text": "It is well known that the western US is heavily dependent on snowfall for water availability, with over 50% of streamflow estimated to come from snow each year"}

{"text": "Using within\u2010unit variation also offers advantages over trend detection (which is a common alternative approach to quantifying the streamflow response to climate\u2010driven changes), as robust trend detection requires a long time series, and the effect of climate\u2010driven changes on streamflow can be hard to distinguish from other long\u2010term changes.\r\n"}
{"text": "To identify the mechanisms responsible for the largest events in each watershed, we categorize each streamflow peak as primarily snowmelt\u2010driven, rainfall\u2010driven or \u201crain\u2010on\u2010snow\u201d\u2010driven."}

{"text": "If there is no increase in streamflow following the precipitation event, we assign an arbitrary streamflow increase of 0.01 ft3 s\u22121 (0.00028 m3 s\u22121) to enable the log transformation used in the panel regression model (see below).\r\n"}
{"text": "When pooling across watersheds, it is necessary to account for differences in the average streamflow response between watersheds resulting from factors such as drainage area, average climate, and land use."}
{"text": "Additionally, there is the possibility of temporal trends in each watershed due to unrelated factors (i.e., changes in the streamflow response over time due to human activity such as land cover change)."}
{"text": "These changes in the rain percentage of precipitation could result from changes in temperature, shifts in the timing of precipitation (towards either warmer or colder parts of the season), or both.\r\n"}
{"text": "Because spring snowmelt is a critical component of streamflow in colder watersheds, the timing of high streamflow is very dependent on the average watershed NDJFM rain percentage (Figure 3b)."}
{"text": "While rain\u2010on\u2010snow events often lead to the largest streamflow peaks, 39% of watersheds have rainfall\u2010driven streamflow peaks that are larger than rain\u2010on\u2010snow\u2010driven peaks, and"}
{"text": "Overall, these results suggest a nonlinear increase in the size of rainfall\u2010driven and rain\u2010on\u2010snow\u2010driven streamflow peaks as the average watershed rain percentage increases (Figure 4a)."}

{"text": "As expected, the shift from snow\u2010dominated precipitation and snowmelt to rain\u2010dominated precipitation significantly affects streamflow, with higher rain percentages leading to a larger streamflow response (Figure 5)."}
{"text": "The step function shows a similar effect of rain percentage on streamflow response (Figure 4c); that is, there is a smaller change in the response of streamflow to increases in rain percentage below 20% and an approximately log\u2010linear relationship above 20%."}
{"text": "We find that precipitation amount and concurrent snowmelt also have statistically significant (p < 0.01) positive effects on the streamflow response, although the effect of snowmelt is larger than that of precipitation (Table 1)."}
{"text": "Consistent with this result, the response to increased rain percentage is larger in the Northwest region (Oregon, Washington, and Idaho) compared to other regions, although the differences between geographic regions are less pronounced than the differences between precipitation regimes (Figure 6e)."}
{"text": "The steepest watersheds are also some of the wettest (Figure S1), so the larger mean response may result from the correlation between average precipitation and watershed slope."}
{"text": "In agreement with recent work showing that natural and managed watersheds respond similarly to climatic changes ("}
{"text": "Taken together, these sensitivity tests identify some important differences in the streamflow response across watersheds, although the pattern of nonlinear increases in response to increasing rain percentage is robust."}
{"text": "We have quantified changes in the streamflow response to variations in the fraction of precipitation and runoff from snow and rain."}
{"text": "In addition, in the panel regression analysis of streamflow immediately following individual precipitation and snowmelt events, we find that the empirical relationship between rain percentage and the subsequent streamflow response is nonlinear, with rain\u2010dominated runoff leading to proportionately larger streamflow peaks than snowmelt\u2010dominated or mixed rain\u2010and\u2010snow runoff (Figures 5 and 6)."}
{"text": "The difference between previous studies and the snowmelt vs. precipitation rates presented in our study could result from biases in modeled snowmelt compared to snow telemetry observations but may also reflect the difference between snowmelt rates at the scale of a monitoring station versus at the scale of an entire watershed."}
{"text": "Our comparisons of snowmelt rates with precipitation intensity at the watershed scale suggest that, as a larger percentage of precipitation falls as rain, it is possible that runoff rates during rainfall events could exceed maximum historical snowmelt rates for most watersheds.\r\n"}
{"text": "Nonlinearity in streamflow peaks has been observed in multiple studies (Robinson et al., 1995; Sivapalan et al., 2002) and can arise from a number of factors including the amount of liquid water input, antecedent conditions that impact runoff efficiency ("}
{"text": "Differences in precipitation intensity during rain compared with mixed rain\u2010and\u2010snow precipitation could also contribute to the nonlinear response."}
{"text": "While physical watershed characteristics such as average slope and watershed area have important effects on differences in streamflow across watersheds, these characteristics do not significantly affect the within\u2010watershed response to changes in rain percentage (Figure 6)."}
{"text": "In other words, the steepest and flattest watersheds experience a similar percent change in streamflow following an increase or decrease in rain percentage."}
{"text": "Our analysis of streamflow events (Figure 4a) agrees with previous work showing that snowmelt\u2010driven peaks decrease in size as the seasonal rain fraction increases (Harpold & Kohler, 2017;"}
{"text": "At the same time, the panel regression (Figures 5 and 6) shows that increases in rain fraction lead to larger streamflow peaks."}
{"text": "Thus, if the timing and amount of precipitation in the western US remains similar in the future but rain fraction increases as projected (e.g., Ashfaq et al., 2013), increases in rainfall\u2010driven and rain\u2010on\u2010snow\u2010driven streamflow peaks could be larger than decreases in snowmelt\u2010driven"}
{"text": "Therefore, higher rain percentages could immediately lead to increases in the largest streamflow peaks."}
{"text": "Temporary reductions in flood risk due to decreases in the size of snowmelt\u2010driven floods are also possible for the coldest watersheds, especially if warming causes some snowmelt to occur earlier in the season, reducing the amount of water stored in snowpack in the spring.\r\n"}
{"text": "The differences between VIC and SNOTEL are likely due to a combination of model error and scale mismatch between the point observations and the NLDAS\u20102 grid."}
{"text": "However, daily\u2010mean streamflow can underestimate the magnitude of instantaneous streamflow peaks, particularly for events with the fastest response times."}
{"text": "Snowmelt\u2010driven streamflow often has a diurnal signal due to a peak in snowmelt rates in the afternoon (Lundquist et al., 2005)."}
{"text": "Therefore, our results may underestimate the streamflow response to rain events where the peak duration is much shorter than 1 day or for snowmelt\u2010driven events where streamflow is likely to rise and fall throughout the day."}
{"text": "That relationship implies large potential for continued regional warming to increase flood risk, even without changes in precipitation frequency, magnitude, or timing."}
{"text": "Rain causes significantly larger flood events than snow, both within watersheds and across our watershed sample."}
{"text": "The approximately exponential relationship means that decreasing snow fraction leads to proportionally larger increases in streamflow."}
{"text": "Further, the wettest watersheds show the largest response to changes in rain/snow fraction."}
{"text": "Extrapolating from our empirical results, wet, mixed\u2010regime watersheds, such as those along the coastal ranges, can be expected to see the most immediate increases in flood size in response to continued warming."}
{"text": "In contrast, high\u2010elevation snow\u2010dominated watersheds may see more delayed changes in flood risk, due to the competing influence of decreasing snowmelt\u2010driven floods and increasing rainfall\u2010driven floods.\r\n"}
{"text": "Increases in flood risk pose a particularly difficult challenge for the western US, where infrastructure is already vulnerable to winter flooding events (CSIWG, 2018)."}
{"text": "The approximately exponential relationship identified in our results emphasizes that temperature\u2010induced changes in snow fraction are likely to strongly influence future changes in flood risk, regardless of uncertainty about future changes in total precipitation.\r\n"}
{"text": "Some 12 hours after that first wave of nausea, as I was sitting alone in my holiday rental, the numbness in my fingers and toes crawled up to my wrists and ankles."}
{"text": "The odd tingling felt as though I\u2019d woken up in an odd position and"}
{"text": "my hands and feet were asleep \u2013 only instead of gradually improving and returning to normal, the numbness just steadily continued."}
{"text": "The culprit, I would eventually find out, was ciguatera: a strange, specific form of food poisoning stemming from a toxin in certain types of fish."}
{"text": "There\u2019s no way to screen fish for it and no known cure, and it\u2019s likely to become far more common as climate change warms our oceans and causes more storms, and more widespread as more fish is exported around the world.\r\n"}
{"text": "This has, of course, bitten me once or twice, usually resulting in a rough night, though nothing serious."}
{"text": "that months later I would still be feeling the repercussions: rolling around in my bed in Seattle, unable to sleep because of the numbness and tingling in my fingers.\r\n"}
{"text": "According to Dr Mindy Richlen, a research specialist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution who studies harmful algal blooms, ciguatera poisoning comes from eating fish contaminated with ciguatoxins, which come from a tropical dinoflagellate (tiny single-cell organism) that lives on microalgae growing, mostly, on dead coral."}
{"text": "While ciguatera initially presents itself as standard food poisoning, it eventually morphs into numbness in the fingers and toes that recurs for months or even years, and sometimes causes a switching of hot and cold sensations (a side effect I thankfully lucked out of, but which leads people to think their cold soda is burning them or causes them to drink far-too-hot coffee).\r\n"}
{"text": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that up to 50,000 cases of ciguatera poisoning are reported annually worldwide, but nobody really knows how common it is\r\n"}
{"text": "Ciguatera has been blamed for a tiny number of deaths over the years \u2013 mostly due to complications stemming from the effects of the toxin on the neurological and digestive system \u2013 but it\u2019s rarely fatal.\r\n"}
{"text": "There\u2019s also no known cure or antidote for ciguatera poisoning.\r\n"}
{"text": "The day after my poisoning, numbness lingered in my hands and feet as I boarded a plane to Mexico City."}
{"text": "The online info noted that recurrent episodes of the neurological effects of ciguatera \u2013 such as numbness \u2013 are thought to be tied to eating certain foods, including one of my personal sushi favourites, red snapper."}
{"text": "Whether due to bleaching, increased hurricane activity or reef degradation from human activities, he said, \u201cI would expect to see ciguatera flaring up as reef health declines.\u201d"}
{"text": "In the last 30 years, 50% of all of the world\u2019s corals have died due in large part to climage change, and some predictions say 90% may die in the next century.\r\n"}

{"text": "Even as officials around the world are scrambling to control a new and increasingly deadly coronavirus outbreak, public health and infectious disease experts are sounding the alarm about climate change making the risk of other novel afflictions much more explosive.\r\n"}
{"text": "Much of that wildlife is being displaced by global warming and habitat loss, putting stressed species that are more susceptible to infection in closer contact with humans."}
{"text": "Global warming can accelerate displacement by thawing, burning, flooding, or drying out habitats in response to hotter temperatures and stronger storms."}
{"text": "In the 1998-1999 Nipah virus outbreak in Malaysia that killed more than 100 people, for example, researchers concluded that fruit bats dislodged by forest fires and an El Ni\u00f1o-related drought began feeding on fruit trees grown on the same farms as pigs."}
{"text": "Fair said stressed animals, whether due to displacement or confinement in live animal markets, are more susceptible to disease."}
{"text": "This \u201csuper-shedder\u201d effect, as it\u2019s known, can further increase the danger of a spillover event.\r\n"}

{"text": "Many microbes never cause disease in humans, of course, but the specter of \u201czombie viruses\u201d waking up after being frozen for millennia in glaciers and permafrost has inspired urgent calls for more surveillance.\r\n"}
{"text": "Global warming may be fueling yet another danger that has so far received little attention, according to Arturo Casadevall, a professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health in Baltimore."}
{"text": "Last year, Casadevall and colleagues reported that human infections caused by the drug-resistant fungal species Candida auris cropped up independently on three continents."}
{"text": "Although the science needed to characterize new outbreaks has progressed rapidly, experts say sustained followup in determining the root causes will be critical to avoiding future pandemics."}
{"text": "Rapid climate change increases the risk that these tailor-made immune systems may be insufficient, and not only in birds."}
{"text": "Global warming has significant negative consequences for human health, with some groups at greater risk than others."}
{"text": "Perhaps not surprising given these findings, respondents demonstrated only limited support for a government response: less than 50% of respondents said government should be doing more to protect against health harms from global warming, and about 33% supported increased funding to public health agencies for this purpose."}
{"text": "Most Americans report a general sense that global warming can be harmful to health, but relatively few understand the types of harm it causes or who is most likely to be affected."}
{"text": "Among vulnerable publics in Asia and Africa, awareness of increasing health harms due to specific changing climatic conditions is high."}
{"text": "The current impacts of climate change include increases in certain types of extreme weather (e.g., heat waves, heavy precipitation) and climatic events (droughts), increased water and food insecurity, rising sea levels and ocean acidification, damage to ecosystems and biodiversity, damage to societal infrastructures, and most directly germane to this article, a range of direct and indirect harms to human health [1\u20133].\r\n"}
{"text": "The US Climate and Health Assessment identified seven major categories of health impacts from climate change, including increased morbidity and mortality from increasing extreme temperatures; temporary reductions in air quality from smog and smoke; increases in extreme weather and climatic events; increasing vector-borne diseases; increasing water-related illness; decreasing food safety, nutrition, and distribution; and mental health conditions including anxiety, depression, and substance use."}
{"text": "While anyone\u2019s health can be harmed by climate change, some people are at greatly increased risk including young children, pregnant women, older adults, people with chronic illnesses and disabilities, outdoor workers, and people with fewer resources [3]."}

{"text": "The health impacts most commonly identified were air pollution-related increases in severity of chronic disease, such as asthma, COPD, and cardiovascular disease; allergic symptoms; heat-related effects; vector-borne illnesses; diarrheal diseases from food-/water-borne agents of infection; and injuries due to extreme weather [18\u201320].\r\n"}

{"text": "From post-disaster traumas to anxiety about the future, people around the world are grappling with the impacts of climate change on mental health \u2013 so much so that the term \u201ceco-anxiety\u201d has gained popularity in the last few years.\r\n"}
{"text": "First, people can experience psychological responses to direct exposure to the consequences of climate change, such as living through a disaster."}
{"text": "The other way that climate change can affect mental health is through indirect exposure \u2013 such as watching a disaster unfold from afar or reading about a dire new scientific report.\r\n"}
{"text": "Morganstein said that after a disaster, the most common psychological responses are \u201cdistress reactions,\u201d such as insomnia, scapegoating, irritability, risky behaviors like substance abuse, and losing interest in normal activities.\r\n"}

{"text": "Disasters affect individuals\u2019 mental health differently."}
{"text": "But certain factors make people more vulnerable to suffering from psychological impacts of natural disasters."}
{"text": "In particular, Morganstein said, people with lower socio-economic status are more likely to live in risk-prone areas and have less access to health care after a disaster.\r\n"}
{"text": "Extreme weather is also linked to more subtle psychological effects."}
{"text": "Research has shown that people are more likely to behave irritably, aggressively, and even violently when exposed to extreme heat."}

{"text": "These processes keep the atmosphere moist, but also help drive convection \u2013 strong upward motion of the air \u2013 which, ultimately, creates clouds and more rainfall."}
{"text": "There are three potential causes of this, explains Prof Richard Betts, head of climate impacts at the Met Office Hadley Centre and chair of climate impacts at the University of Exeter.\r\n"}
{"text": "The first is a decline in rainfall in response to a warming climate."}
{"text": "Model projections suggest this would be a result of \u201cparticular patterns of sea surface temperature (SST) change in the tropical Atlantic and Pacific\u201d, says Betts, but there is a lot of variation between models as to how strong the impact would be on the Amazon."}
{"text": "Finally, the third cause would be the direct impact of deforestation \u2013 fewer trees mean less evapotranspiration and less moisture entering the atmosphere.\r\n"}
{"text": "Betts says that \u201c3C is the lowest level of warming that might trigger it, but it might need much higher warming\u201d.\r\n"}
{"text": "One of those contributing factors is deforestation, which could hasten a shift to savannah as a \u201cfragmented forest is probably more sensitive to rainfall reductions driven by global heating\u201d, says Betts.\r\n"}

{"text": "Amazon dieback would also make it more difficult to tackle climate change, he notes:\r\n\u201cIncreased release of CO2 from forest fires and tree death would accelerate CO2 rise, and with the forest gone we would also have lost an important carbon sink which would mean that deeper emissions cuts would be needed to stop the rise in atmospheric CO2.\u201d\r\n"}

{"text": "It was Giannini\u2019s 2003 Science paper that identified that the cause of the drought primarily lay in warm SSTs around Africa, not desertification caused by farmers and an expanding population."}
{"text": "This saw the monsoon rains shift southwards away from the Sahel, causing drought."}
{"text": "The effect was reinforced by the \u201cclimate-vegetation feedback\u201d, where drier conditions saw less vegetation growth, a reduction in evapotranspiration and even less rainfall.\r\n"}
{"text": "Subsequent research by Giannini has shown the combination of warming of the tropical oceans (in response to rising greenhouse gases) and cooling in the North Atlantic (as a result of air pollution from northern hemisphere countries) led to drying of the Sahel.\r\n"}

{"text": "Finally, research has also suggested that the WAM could be affected by another tipping point \u2013 a significant slowdown of the AMOC."}
{"text": "Why AMOC slowdown, which occurs in the high latitude North Atlantic, leads to WAM weakening is \u201cstill an open question\u201d, says Chiang:\r\n"}
{"text": "The other is that ocean circulation changes resulting from the AMOC slowdown \u2018rewires\u2019 the currents around the tropical Atlantic, leading to a warmer South tropical Atlantic and thus causing a weakening of the WAM.\u201d\r\n"}

{"text": "Similarly, rapid permafrost thaw can also be triggered \u2013 and enhanced \u2013 by disturbances such as fire, abrupt drying events, soil subsidence and erosion resulting from ice-rich permafrost thaw (known as \u201cthermokarst\u201d)."}
{"text": "Overall, the evidence indicates that there are several mechanisms for abrupt regional thawing, says Armstrong McKay, while for permafrost thaw more generally, it is expected that it \u201cwill act as more of a continuous positive feedback on climate change rather than an abrupt tipping point\u201d."}

{"text": "This shift is driven by the movements of the sun through the seasons, explains Dr Andrew Turner, associate professor in monsoon systems at the University of Reading."}
{"text": "This causes a prevailing wind over India from the north-east, bringing dry air from across the Asian landmass.\r\n"}

{"text": "A potential cause could be air pollution \u2013 from India itself and the wider region, Turner says:\r\n\u201cAir pollution comes in several forms, but most of it is in the form of sulphur compounds \u2013 for example, emissions of sulphur dioxide from industry and transport \u2013 that form sulphates in the atmosphere."}

{"text": "The mix of influences resulting from human activity is one of the reasons that making projections for the monsoon is tricky."}
{"text": "In other words, a significant factor in maintaining the monsoon is the heat released when the water vapour it holds condenses to form rain."}
{"text": "The implication is that this feedback magnifies anything that affects the air pressure gradient generated by warm air rising over the Asian landmass."}

{"text": "The IER forms the basis of the estimates of disease burden attributable to PM2.5 (e.g., 4 million deaths in 2015) in the global burden of disease (GBD) (1), those of the World Health Organization (WHO) (5), and in the quantification of impacts of policy scenarios on projected improvements in population health burden and evaluation of air-quality standards (6, 7).\r\n"}

{"text": "Depending on location, the onset of spring snowmelt is occurring 1-4 weeks earlier today than it did in the late 1940s.\r\n"}
{"text": "Every ecosystem type, however, is projected to experience an increase in average annual burn area.\r\n"}
{"text": "Climate change is thought to be a principal cause of this \u201cdeoxygenation\u201d, affecting how much oxygen seawater can hold and the circulation patterns that carry oxygen-rich water to the deeper ocean.\r\n"}
{"text": "Our findings show that climate models underestimate deoxygenation to date, but project that it will continue and accelerate."}
{"text": "Dangers of deoxygenation\r\n"}
{"text": "\u201cOxygen minimum zones\u201d are a natural phenomenon, caused by the combined action of sluggish ocean circulation and the decomposition of organic matter sinking out of productive surface areas often associated with ocean upwelling regions.\r\n"}
{"text": "And the risk of deoxygenation is not just limited to these specific zones."}
{"text": "The most recent and comprehensive analysis of oxygen changes in the global oceans suggests there has been an average 2% decline since 1960.\r\n"}
{"text": "Research shows that human-caused global warming is the principal cause of marine oxygen loss."}
{"text": "Warming affects the ocean and its dissolved oxygen content in several ways."}
{"text": "This effect explains up to 20% of the total marine oxygen loss so far and about 50% of that in the upper 1,000 metres of the oceans.\r\n"}
{"text": "In addition, warming alters patterns of global ocean circulation, which affects the mixing of oxygen-rich surface waters with deeper oxygen-poor water."}
{"text": "Finally, there are indirect impacts of warming on upper-ocean nutrient supply and subsequent production and downward export of organic matter available for respiration throughout the ocean.\r\n"}
{"text": "In general, climate model simulations underestimate the scale of the observed deoxygenation."}
{"text": "While the decreased solubility of oxygen in warming seawater is generally well represented in models, improvements are needed to better capture the other impacts of rising temperatures.\r\n"}
{"text": "Biogeochemical feedbacks that can lead to accelerated oxygen loss, such as the release of phosphorus and iron from sediments beneath oxygen-free waters, are also not accounted for in most models today and may explain part of why they underestimate the deoxygenation to date.\r\n"}
{"text": "Ocean oxygen loss is increasingly being recognised as a major threat to marine ecosystems and shifting habitat conditions in many parts of the global ocean.\r\n"}
{"text": "Deoxygenation feedbacks on climate via the production of potent greenhouse gases such as N2O and methane under low-oxygen conditions become more likely in a warmer climate."}
{"text": "An analysis of winter temperatures indicates that 98% (236) of 242 cities had an increase in average winter temperatures from 1970, with the highest increases around the Great Lakes and Northeast region."}
{"text": "Akin to a warming fall season, a warmer winter can have negative impacts."}
{"text": "Extreme heat may not trigger the same visceral fear as a tornado, but according to NOAA\u2019s natural hazard statistics, it causes nearly twice as many fatalities in the United States each year \u2013 more than any other weather hazard."}
{"text": "Since the late 1800s, human-caused climate change has warmed the Earth\u2019s average temperature by around 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit)."}
{"text": "That doesn\u2019t sound like much, but a relatively small warming of the average temperature results in a large jump in extreme heat.\r\n"}
{"text": "Why does a modest increase in the average temperature lead to extreme heat?\r\n"}
{"text": "How often is extreme heat occurring today?\r\n"}
{"text": "Extreme heat occurred very rarely 50 years ago in the United States.\r\n"}
{"text": "As a result, extreme summer heat now occurs about 7% of the time.\r\n"}
{"text": "Hansen\u2019s paper reports that the warming effect has been even larger for the Mediterranean and Middle East."}
{"text": "Is there a link between climate change and recent heat waves?\r\n"}
{"text": "The American Meteorological Society defines a heat wave as \u201ca period of abnormally and uncomfortably hot and usually humid weather.\u201d"}
{"text": "There have been a number of notable heat waves during the past two decades.\r\n"}
{"text": "For instance, the European Heat Wave of 2003 is estimated to have caused an astounding 70,000 deaths."}
{"text": "Researchers found that human influence at least doubled the risk of a heat wave of that magnitude."}
{"text": "In 2010, another 56,000 people died in a heat wave in Russia."}
{"text": "A 2011 study concluded that there is an 80% probability the heat wave would not have occurred without global warming.\r\n"}
{"text": "An exceptional heat wave \u2013 nicknamed \u201cLucifer\u201d \u2013 occurred in southern Europe in 2017."}
{"text": "And more recently, in the summer of 2019, two intense heat waves in Europe just weeks apart shattered various all-time records."}
{"text": "Both were linked to human-caused climate change.\r\n"}
{"text": "The first heat wave in late June 2019 led to a temperature of 115 degrees F in France, eclipsing the all-time country record by more than three degrees."}
{"text": "A World Weather Attribution study found that the core of the heat wave was around seven degrees F warmer than it would have been a century ago and that a heat wave of this magnitude is at least 10 times more likely now.\r\n"}
{"text": "In late July, another history-making heat wave set new all-time record highs in the UK, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, and Luxembourg."}
{"text": "F. A World Weather Attribution study found the heat wave was 10 to 100 times more likely to occur now than it would have been before the Industrial Revolution.\r\n"}
{"text": "This same heat wave then built north into the Arctic, resulting in the biggest melt day in recent Greenland history.\r\n"}
{"text": "It is important to recognize that heat waves are not just restricted to land."}
{"text": "In 2016, a quarter of the planet\u2019s ocean surface experienced either the longest or most intense marine heat wave on record."}
{"text": "In a study of two affected regions \u2013 the Bering Sea of Alaska and waters off northern Australia \u2013 researchers concluded that the event was up to 50 times more likely due to human-caused climate change."}
{"text": "The abnormally hot water triggered the worst mass coral-bleaching event on record for the Great Barrier Reef.\r\n"}
{"text": "Researchers also found the 2017-2018 Tasman Sea marine heat wave to be \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d without the influence of human-caused emissions.\r\n"}
{"text": "What can we expect from heat waves in the future?\r\n"}
{"text": "In a 2019 study, researchers at Princeton University found that as global temperatures increase, heat waves will become more frequent and the time between them will become shorter.\r\n"}
{"text": "An investigation of future regional heat waves finds that the number of heat-wave days may increase by 4 to 34 days per season for every one degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) of increased global warming."}
{"text": "A study released by the Union of Concerned Scientists in July 2019 finds a dramatic increase in dangerous heat index days because of combined higher temperatures and humidity."}
{"text": "What are the consequences of extreme heat?\r\n"}
{"text": "A large increase in extreme heat will come with consequences."}
{"text": "Greater marine heat waves may wipe out the majority of global coral reefs by mid-century, along the vulnerable creatures that rely on them and the human services the reefs provide.\r\n"}
{"text": "The result: losses in agriculture, more intense large wildfires, and a longer fire season.\r\n"}
{"text": "Worker productivity will likely suffer as increases in heat and humidity push the limits of human tolerance, making it difficult for outdoor workers to stay cool.\r\n"}
{"text": "A 2017 study concludes: \u201cIt\u2019s the sustained nature of heat waves that impose more devastating impacts than extreme temperatures on a single day."}
{"text": "Excessive human morbidity and mortality rates are clearly associated with sustained extreme temperatures.\u201d\r\n"}
{"text": "The 2018 National Climate Assessment estimates that in 49 large U.S. cities alone, changes in extreme temperatures are projected to result in more than 9,000 additional premature deaths by the end of the century in a \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d emissions scenario."}
{"text": "That\u2019s a conservative estimate compared to an analysis from the Natural Resources Defense Council, which found that an increase in dangerous hot days could lead summertime deaths across large U.S. urban areas to grow from the 1975-2010 annual average of about 1,360 to 13,860 by the mid-2040s, and to 29,850 by late century.\r\n"}
{"text": "There is the danger that humidity will literally become unbearable by the end of this century for people living in regions like the Persian Gulf and South China."}
{"text": "According to Dr Tom Matthews of Loughborough University in the UK, once the wet bulb temperature (temperature of the air factoring in cooling as a result of evaporation) reaches 95 degrees F, the body can no longer cool itself through evaporation of sweat, which can lead to heat stroke and death."}
{"text": "The ice loss from Greenland and Antarctica is tracking the worst-case climate warming scenario set out by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), scientists say."}
{"text": "Without rapid cuts to carbon emissions the analysis indicates there could be a rise in sea levels that would leave 400 million people exposed to coastal flooding each year by the end of the century.\r\n"}
{"text": "Rising sea levels are the one of the most damaging long-term impacts of the climate crisis, and the contribution of Greenland and Antarctica is accelerating."}
{"text": "The previous peak year for Greenland and Antarctic ice melting was 2010, after a natural climate cycle led to a run of very hot summers."}
{"text": "But the Arctic heatwave of 2019 means it is nearly certain that more ice was lost last year.\r\n"}
{"text": "The average annual loss of ice from Greenland and Antarctica in the 2010s was 475bn tonnes \u2013 six times greater than the 81bn tonnes a year lost in the 1990s."}
{"text": "\u201cEvery centimetre of sea level rise leads to coastal flooding and coastal erosion, disrupting people\u2019s lives around the planet,\u201d said Prof Andrew Shepherd, of the University of Leeds."}
{"text": "Almost all the ice loss from Antarctica and half of that from Greenland arose from warming oceans melting the glaciers that flow from the ice caps."}
{"text": "The remainder of Greenland\u2019s ice losses are caused by hotter air temperatures that melt the surface of the ice sheet.\r\n"}
{"text": "About a third of the total sea level rise now comes from Greenland and Antarctic ice loss."}
{"text": "Just under half comes from the thermal expansion of warming ocean water and a fifth from other smaller glaciers."}
{"text": "Shepherd said the ice caps had been slow to respond to human-caused global heating."}
{"text": "\u201cWe can offset some of that [sea level rise] if we stop heating the planet.\u201d\r\n"}
{"text": "She said she also saw increased losses from Iceland\u2019s ice caps last year."}
{"text": "Now, questions have arisen about whether climate change contributed to the outbreak of COVID-19, whose spread the World Health Organization declared a pandemic on Wednesday."}
{"text": "For example, did habitat loss, driven in part by climate change, make it easier for pathogens to spread among wildlife and for the virus to jump to humans?"}
{"text": "Does air pollution, mainly from the burning of fossil fuels, make some people more vulnerable to contracting the illness?\r\n"}
{"text": "We spoke to Dr. Aaron Bernstein, a pediatrician and Interim Director of The Center for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment at Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health (Harvard C-CHANGE), who has seen firsthand how climate change can harm children, mostly through the burning of fossil fuels."}
{"text": "I think the strongest links I see are actually related, first of all, to air pollution, and fossil fuels as a source of air pollution, and fossil fuels, of course, are the major cause of climate change."}
{"text": "There are a lot of things that lead to habitat loss for species and bring them into closer proximity to human communities."}
{"text": "To be clear, we don't know with COVID, what role if any the climate effects that we're already seeing in species around the world may have had on the risk of this disease emerging."}
{"text": "We're watching all kinds of life forms run away from the heat, and that has led to the spread of pathogens, because animals that carry pathogens came in contact with other animals that didn't carry those pathogens and there was transmission."}
{"text": "The constraints upon animal migration because of habitat loss may force animals into closer proximity."}
{"text": "There are lots of forces, and habitat loss is a major contributor to it.\r\n"}
{"text": "I want to go back to the original thing you said when I asked you to tease out these links to climate, and that is about air pollution from fossil fuels, and how that affects human vulnerability to a respiratory ailment like COVID-19."}
{"text": "Burning anything, so it could be indoor pollution from cook stoves."}
{"text": "Air pollution is strongly associated with people's risk of getting pneumonia and getting sicker when they do get pneumonia."}
{"text": "We don't really have much in the way of evidence to show that connection with the COVID epidemics.\r\n"}
{"text": "Given what we know now, it would be very surprising to find that air pollution didn't affect the risk of people either getting the disease or getting sicker when they do get the disease.\r\n"}
{"text": "We have lots of research that shows that air pollution, particularly particulate matter air pollution, increases the risk of people getting sick with bacterial and viral pathogens that cause pneumonia, and that people who are exposed to more air pollution get sicker when they get exposed to those kinds of pathogens.\r\n"}
{"text": "I hear the echoes, and I was wondering if you hear those echoes, too, between that push back and climate denial?"}
{"text": "It's hard to know where that lack of concern comes from."}
{"text": "When there is this kind of push back or minimizing of the threat of this virus, what could the public health consequences be?\r\n"}
{"text": "Wildfires, which destroy forests and habitat, can lead to human-animal interfaces that wouldn't have happened."}
{"text": "Climate change is a destabilizing force when it comes to the spread of infection through several potential pathways.\r\n"}
{"text": "Though the region has seen locust plagues since biblical times, the scale of the current outbreak is the largest seen in 25 years in Ethiopia and Somalia \u2013 and in 70 years in Kenya.\r\n"}
{"text": "In particular, they have suggested that the plague has been worsened by recent heavy rains and unusual storm activity in the East African region."}
{"text": "In Ethiopia, the swarms also caused a plane to veer off course after insects slammed into its nose, engine and windshields.\r\n"}
{"text": "In its latest update on 2 March, the FAO\u2019s locust watch service said the threat from locusts currently remains high in East Africa, parts of the Middle East and Pakistan.\r\n"}
{"text": ": On 14 April, the FAO Locust Watch released a further statement saying that \u201cwidespread rains\u2026in late March are expected to cause a dramatic increase in locust numbers in East Africa, eastern Yemen and southern Iran in the coming months\u201d."}
{"text": "Efforts to control locust numbers have been hampered by the coronavirus outbreak, which is causing delays to pesticide deliveries across country borders, Kenyan officials told the Guardian.)\r\n"}
{"text": "The outbreaks in India are the worst seen in the country for 25 years, reports the New York Times.)\r\n"}
{"text": "The FAO has estimated that the current outbreak is the largest seen in 70 years in Kenya and in 25 years in Somalia and Ethiopia."}
{"text": "Pakistan officials say the outbreak there is the worst in 30 years.\r\n"}
{"text": "However, it is worth noting that the factors driving locust swarms are largely regional \u2013 and global trends in locust outbreaks would, therefore, not be expected, scientists tell Carbon Brief."}
{"text": "Some media reports have pointed to a link between the current outbreak and unusual storm and rainfall activity around East Africa.\r\n"}
{"text": "The Arabian Peninsula \u2013 the land mass between East Africa and Asia comprising Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Oman, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates \u2013 was struck by several unusually severe cyclones between 2018 and 2019.\r\n"}
{"text": "The moisture caused lush vegetation to grow in the usually barren environment, attracting desert locusts hunting for food into the area, Lehmann tells Carbon Brief."}
{"text": "Spurred on by the ample food supply provided by the cyclones\u2019 rains, the locusts multiplied rapidly \u2013 increasing their numbers 8,000-fold in just a few months.\r\n"}
{"text": "Overall, the Horn of Africa was hit by eight cyclones in 2019, the largest number in any year since 1976.\r\n"}
{"text": "The unusual wet weather in East Africa is linked to a wider climate system known as the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)."}
{"text": "(The IOD also sometimes referred to as the \u201cIndian Ni\u00f1o\u201d because of its similarities to El Ni\u00f1o in the Pacific.)\r\n"}
{"text": "In a neutral dipole phase, waters around Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Australia are warm, which causes air to rise up and fall as rain."}
{"text": "This, in turn, plays a role in driving cyclones and heavy rainfall in the region."}
{"text": "Cyclone frequency increases during a positive dipole phase because the additional warmth and moisture brought by the climate system acts as fuel for budding storms."}
{"text": "As well as driving rains in East Africa, the strongly positive dipole also played a role in driving Australia\u2019s unprecedented 2019-2020 bushfires."}
{"text": "(A recent analysis by the World Weather Attribution initiative found the conditions for fire in Australia were made \u201cmuch more severe\u201d by the positive dipole phase.)\r\n"}
{"text": "Some people have suggested that the extreme wet weather seen during the 2018 and 2019 dipoles could be linked to climate change.\r\n"}
{"text": "\u201cThere is a link between climate change and the unprecedented locust crisis plaguing Ethiopia and East Africa."}
{"text": "This is getting worse by the day.\u201d\r\n"}
{"text": "\u201cIt\u2019s highly likely that the event that we\u2019ve just seen has a very strong warming component in it \u2013 but attributing individual events to long-term climate change is not a simple issue.\u201d\r\n"}
{"text": "The chart shows how the mode index reached its highest recorded level in the northern hemisphere winter of 2019, the time when East Africa was hit by heavy rains and unusual cyclone activity.\r\n"}
{"text": "\u201cThere is always a role for natural variability, but we think this is due, in a large part, to climate change because this persistent trend of 60-70 years is not fully consistent with, for example, decadal variability, which would have gone up and down over a 70-year period.\u201d\r\n"}
{"text": "And, so, it\u2019s much easier to have the rising air that brings rain happening in the western part of the Indian Ocean.\u201d\r\n"}
{"text": "Further analysis by Cai and colleagues found that uncontrolled future climate change could cause positive dipole events to increase by a factor of three by 2099, when compared to the period 1900-1999.\r\n"}
{"text": "Such increases are likely to bring about more frequent and intense cyclones, says Dr Agus Sontoso, a senior research associate at the Climate Change Research Centre at the University of New South Wales in Sydney."}
{"text": "So it\u2019s reasonable to think that under climate change, we expect to see more frequent, if not stronger, cyclones in the region.\u201d\r\n"}
{"text": "What other factors are playing a role in the current locust outbreak?\r\n"}
{"text": "Though the rainy weather played a role in driving the current locust outbreak, there are several factors that could have contributed to the insects\u2019 spread, scientists tell Carbon Brief.\r\n"}
{"text": "\u201cThis specific crisis is also due to the fact there was no preventative management in many of the places where the rain fell."}
{"text": "It is worth noting that other parts of Africa, including Niger and Mauritania, periodically experience heavy rains, but do not see outbreaks on the same scale, says Piou:\r\n"}
{"text": "Another possible driver influencing the current outbreak could be an increase in irrigated agriculture in parts of East Africa, says Lehmann:\r\n"}
{"text": "Though studies suggest that the wet conditions seen in Africa during the winter 2019 are likely to become more frequent with climate change, it is less clear if there will be a corresponding increase in locust outbreaks, scientists tell Carbon Brief.\r\n"}
{"text": "This is because many factors influence the chance of an outbreak, including human factors such as taking early preventative measures, says Piou:\r\n"}
{"text": "Overall, climate change is expected to make weather conditions in East Africa less predictable \u2013 which is likely to benefit insect pests, he adds:\r\n"}
{"text": "They said it was almost always human behaviour that caused diseases to spill over into humans.\r\n"}
{"text": "To prevent further outbreaks, the experts said, both global heating and the destruction of the natural world for farming, mining and housing have to end, as both drive wildlife into contact with people.\r\n"}
{"text": "She also noted other environmental impacts, such as the Australian bushfires, broken heat records and the worst locust invasion in Kenya for 70 years."}
{"text": "Human infectious disease outbreaks are rising and in recent years there have been Ebola, bird flu, Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers), Rift Valley fever, severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars), West Nile virus and Zika virus all cross from animals to humans.\r\n"}
{"text": "\u201cThe emergence and spread of Covid-19 was not only predictable, it was predicted [in the sense that] there would be another viral emergence from wildlife that would be a public health threat,\u201d said Prof Andrew Cunningham, of the Zoological Society of London."}
{"text": "Cunningham said other diseases from wildlife had much higher fatality rates in people, such as 50% for Ebola and 60%-75% for Nipah virus, transmitted from bats in south Asia."}
{"text": "\u201cIt\u2019s almost always a human behaviour that causes it and there will be more in the future unless we change,\u201d said Cunningham."}
{"text": "The ease of travel in the modern world exacerbates the dangers, he said, adding: \u201cThese days, you can be in a central African rainforest one day and in central London the next.\u201d\r\n"}
{"text": "The Covid-19 crisis may provide an opportunity for change, but Cunningham is not convinced it will be taken: \u201cI thought things would have changed after Sars, which was a massive wake up call \u2013 the biggest economic impact of any emerging disease to that date,\u201d he said.\r\n"}
{"text": "Then there was a huge sigh of relief and it was back to business as usual."}
{"text": "From broken healthcare to corrosive racial inequality, from rapacious corporations to a climate crisis, the need for fact-based reporting that highlights injustice and offers solutions is as great as ever."}
{"text": "As I have shown before, food production is responsible for one-quarter of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions.\r\n"}
{"text": "GHG emissions from transportation make up a very small amount of the emissions from food and what you eat is far more important than where your food traveled from.\r\n"}
{"text": "In the visualization we see GHG emissions from 29 different food products \u2013 from beef at the top to nuts at the bottom.\r\n"}
{"text": "To capture all GHG emissions from food production researchers therefore express them in kilograms of \u2018carbon dioxide equivalents\u2019."}
{"text": "The most important insight from this study: there are massive differences in the GHG emissions of different foods: producing a kilogram of beef emits 60 kilograms of greenhouse gases (CO2-equivalents)."}
{"text": "While peas emits just 1 kilogram per kg.\r\n"}
{"text": "Lamb and cheese both emit more than 20 kilograms CO2-equivalents per kilogram."}
{"text": "For most foods \u2013 and particularly the largest emitters \u2013 most GHG emissions result from land use change (shown in green), and from processes at the farm stage (brown)."}
{"text": "Transport is a small contributor to emissions."}
{"text": "Food transport was responsible for only 6% of emissions, whilst dairy, meat and eggs accounted for 83%.4\r\n"}
{"text": "But for the few products which are transported by air, the emissions can be very high: it emits 50 times more CO2eq than boat per tonne kilometer.10\r\n"}
{"text": "Not just the illness and death sweeping the planet."}
{"text": "In Seattle, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Atlanta, the fog of pollution has lifted."}
{"text": "Coronavirus has led to an astonishing shutdown of economic activity and a drastic reduction in the use of fossil fuels."}
{"text": "In China, measures to contain the virus in February alone caused a drop in carbon emissions of an estimated 25 percent."}
{"text": "In the short term, response to the pandemic seems to be having a positive effect on emissions."}
{"text": "As the United Nations\u2019 secretary general recently noted, the threat from coronavirus is temporary whereas the threat from heat waves, floods and extreme storms resulting in the loss of human life will remain with us for years.\r\n"}
{"text": "The efforts to revive economic activity \u2014 the stimulus plans, bailouts and back-to-work programs being developed now \u2014 will help determine the shape of our economies and our lives for the foreseeable future, and they will have effects on carbon emissions that reverberate across the planet for thousands of years.\r\n"}
{"text": "Sweeping changes in individual habits \u2014 particularly in wealthy countries with high per capita consumption \u2014 could lead to lower emissions, which would be an unequivocal good."}
{"text": "But personal habits may matter less because of direct reductions in carbon emissions and more because of \u201cbehavioral contagion,\u201d a term from the social sciences that refers to the way ideas and behaviors spread through a population and can, in terms of climate action, lead to changes in voting and even policy.\r\n"}
{"text": "Which is to say, in order to be meaningful for global emissions, changes in consumption habits as a result of the virus would need to extend beyond individuals to the larger structures that shape our lives."}
{"text": "In China, it wasn\u2019t telecommuting or grounded planes that led to the 25 percent drop in emissions."}
{"text": "But aviation accounts for only about 2.5 percent of global emissions, an amount that looks downright puny in the shadow cast by heavy industry.\r\n"}
{"text": "Of course, there\u2019s good reason for concern that despite the clean air and canals of the past three weeks, coronavirus will be a disaster for the climate.\r\n"}
{"text": "According to the oil-trading firm Trafigura, coronavirus may lead to global oil demand seeing its biggest contraction in history, perhaps by more than 10 million barrels per day."}
{"text": "While this may be good news for carbon emissions now, it signals a human disaster of epic proportions without any guarantee that emissions will remain low.\r\n"}
{"text": "Yes, we could see a sustained emissions drop as economies stagnate and people struggle with the harsh daily realities of a global recession."}
{"text": "But there were also dips in emissions during the 2008 financial crisis and the oil shocks of the 1970s, and emissions bounced back as economies recovered."}
{"text": "A global recession as a result of coronavirus shutdowns could also slow or stall the shift to clean energy."}
{"text": "Coronavirus is bad for the climate even on the most macro levels."}
{"text": "This is what happened in China after the 2008 global economic crisis."}
{"text": "It\u2019s unlikely we will see a four-day workweek anytime soon, but the profound disruptions of the pandemic provide a rare opportunity, even in the midst of great suffering, for rewiring our sense of what is possible in American society."}
{"text": "Maybe the rupture caused by \u201cshelter in place\u201d orders provides a glimpse of what work is \u201cessential\u201d to society \u2014 care work, education and food distribution."}
{"text": "The crushing blows of the coronavirus pandemic, like those of the climate crisis, will be felt hardest by our most vulnerable populations \u2014 the poor, the elderly, the homeless, the stateless, the incarcerated, and the precariously employed \u2014 while international corporations driven by the logics of profit and endless growth to seek new markets, cheap labor, and what the sociologist Jason Moore has called \u201ccheap nature,\u201d thereby connecting the world and helping create the conditions for crisis, will most likely remain relatively protected.\r\n"}
{"text": "And global warming is likely to make the problem worse.\r\n"}
{"text": "So climate change could lead to even more bark beetle outbreaks in already-stressed western forests.\r\n"}
{"text": "Climate events \u2014 such as heat waves, extreme storms or glacial retreat \u2014 are events that were made more likely, severe, or damaging due to the increase in greenhouse gases from human activities\r\n"}
{"text": "Natural variation is still the dominant determinant for the frequency and severity of most climate events."}
{"text": "However, climate change is now an additional factor to consider when examining the context and shape of any climate event.\r\n"}
{"text": "While cities are responsible for some 70% of energy-related carbon emissions, they are also home to extraordinary innovation, are financial hubs and incubators for entrepreneurial spirit.\r\n"}
{"text": "Every aspect of our lives has been affected by the coronavirus."}
{"text": "But as the International Agency has said, the effects of coronavirus are likely to be temporary but the other global emergency \u2013 climate change \u2013 is not.\r\n"}
{"text": "But the current unintended economic slowdown opens the door to such a transition, which would bring myriad benefits to the climate.\r\n"}
{"text": "There are several reasons for this dramatic difference."}
{"text": "Climate change is a relatively slow-moving crisis, whereas coronavirus visibly escalates over days, even hours, increasing our perception of the risks involved."}
{"text": "As others have observed, the slow increase in global temperatures means humans can psychologically adjust as the situation worsens, making the problem seem less urgent and meaning people are less willing to accept drastic policy measures.\r\n"}
{"text": "Act early: The coronavirus pandemic shows the crucial importance of early action to prevent catastrophic consequences."}

{"text": "Very often, however, they have synergistic detrimental effects on asthma, influencing not only quality of care but also exposure to environmental and lifestyle (EL) risk factors.\r\n"}
{"text": "Known or potential EL risk factors for disparities in asthma or asthma morbidity include cigarette smoking and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), prematurity or low birth weight, allergen exposure, indoor and outdoor air pollution, diet, obesity, vitamin D insufficiency, viral respiratory infections (e.g., due to crowding), psychosocial stress, and poor adherence with prescribed treatment."}

{"text": "In the end, experts agree that the only way to lessen the threat-multiplying effects of climate change is to slow global warming by transitioning away from fossil fuels as quickly as possible, while building a smarter and greener power grid that can handle the added stresses brought on by the kinds of extreme climate change-amplified weather California is suffering through.\r\n"}
{"text": "Stronger wind speeds, more rain, and worsened storm surge add up to more potential destruction.\r\n"}
{"text": "Major hurricanes are by far the world\u2019s costliest natural weather disasters, in some cases causing well over $100 billion in damage."}
{"text": "There\u2019s now evidence that the unnatural effects of human-caused global warming are already making hurricanes stronger and more destructive."}
{"text": "Whether called hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean, typhoons in the western Pacific Ocean, or cyclones in the Indian Ocean, strong tropical cyclones are an example of nature\u2019s fiercest fury.\r\n"}
{"text": "As it gets stronger the system graduates to a tropical storm and then finally, when winds rise over 74 mph, it is termed a hurricane.\r\n"}
{"text": "So it\u2019s reasonable to assume that as humans continue to release planet-warming greenhouse gases, the likelihood of tropical cyclone activity increases.\r\n"}
{"text": "In addition, authors of a 2013 study found no human-caused signal in annual global tropical cyclone or hurricane frequencies.\r\n"}
{"text": "The authors attribute that increase to global heating of the climate: \u201cWe conclude that since 1975 there has been a substantial and observable regional and global increase in the proportion of Cat 4-5 hurricanes of 25-30 percent per \u00b0C of anthropogenic (human-caused) global warming.\u201d\r\n"}
{"text": "Interestingly, the increase in those most powerful of storms is balanced by a similar decrease in category 1 and category 2 hurricanes."}
{"text": "The authors put forth this intriguing theory: \u201cWe suggest that this [balance] arises from the capped nature of tropical cyclones to a maximum value defined by the potential intensity, which increases only slightly with global warming.\u201d\r\n"}
{"text": "Are hurricanes intensifying more rapidly?\r\n"}
{"text": "Rapid intensification, defined as an increase of wind speed of at least 35 mph in 24 hours, has recently garnered a lot of attention as a result of hurricanes like Harvey, Irma, Maria and Michael in 2017 and 2018."}
{"text": "The study\u2019s authors attribute most of the gains to a shift into the warmer phase of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, a natural cycle.\r\n"}
{"text": "So while the team cannot attribute the rapid intensification gains to human-caused warming, they do say human-caused warming significantly increases extreme tropical cyclone intensification rates in the HiFLOR model.\r\n"}
{"text": "Are hurricanes producing more rain?\r\n"}
{"text": "When it comes to the link between a warming world and weather, one of the most well-understood and robust connections is increased rainfall."}
{"text": "Generally, the increase in rainfall follows the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which dictates that for every one degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) increase, the atmosphere can hold 7% more moisture.\r\n"}
{"text": "This increase in moisture and rainfall does not fall uniformly; in tropical cyclones this effect is boosted."}
{"text": "In a 2018 paper about the link between increasing ocean heat content and hurricanes, lead author Kevin Trenberth of the National Center for Atmospheric Research explains that \u201cthe convergence of moisture into a storm not only leads to higher precipitation but also, for certain storms, greater intensity and growth.\u201d"}
{"text": "So we can see that a combination of warmer air and water lead to increases in rainfall beyond the simple Clausius-Clapeyron relationship.\r\n"}
{"text": "A good example of that is the unprecedented 60 inches of rain that fell in 2017 in southeast Texas in Hurricane Harvey."}
{"text": "Researchers have concluded that a repeat of rainfall that intense is predicted to happen only once every 9,000 years."}
{"text": "A majority of the rain was caused by Harvey\u2019s extremely slow movement."}
{"text": "But multiple attribution studies conclude that a significant amount of rain can be traced to human-caused warming, with various estimates ranging from 15% to 20% to 38%."}
{"text": "Using the term \u201cbiblical\u201d to describe Harvey\u2019s rainfall, MIT\u2019s Kerry Emanuel calculates a six-fold increase in the probability of an event of that magnitude since just the late 20th century.\r\n"}
{"text": "A team investigating extreme rainfall in Hurricane Maria reached a similar conclusion: \u201c[E]xtreme precipitation, like that of Hurricane Maria, has become much more likely in recent years and long\u2010term trends in atmospheric and sea surface temperature are both linked to increased precipitation in Puerto Rico.\u201d"}
{"text": "That paper finds the probability of rainfall of Maria\u2019s magnitude has increased by a factor of almost five in the most heavily impacted areas.\r\n"}
{"text": "Some climate scientists theorize that slower steering currents resulting from a warmer climate may have contributed to Harvey\u2019s lethargic movement."}
{"text": "Even more concerning \u2013 because of the impact on flooding \u2013 is the heightened slowdown detected over land areas: 21% in the western north Pacific and 16% in the North Atlantic."}
{"text": "Authors of another study support these concerns, finding a significant positive trend over the past several decades in coastal rainfall from tropical cyclones that stall."}
{"text": "That study does not, however, reach a conclusion on the reason for the increased stalling.\r\n"}
{"text": "This decrease in number of storms is generally believed to be a byproduct of increasing wind shear \u2013 hostile environmental winds \u2013 expected in the tropics."}
{"text": "But there may be another, more significant reason for the anticipated decrease in storm number.\r\n"}
{"text": "According to Emanuel of MIT, an increase in saturation deficit of the atmosphere at cloud level is the culprit identified on model simulations."}
{"text": "\u201cThere is a strong consensus in the tropical cyclone climate community that the incidence of high-category events will increase, and that storms will precipitate more,\u201d Emanuel said.\r\n"}
{"text": "According to NOAA, 85% of all damages from hurricanes come from category 3, 4, and 5 storms."}
{"text": "That\u2019s the case in part because of their intense winds."}
{"text": "In a 2015 paper using future model simulations, Knutson found an \u201cincrease in average cyclone intensity, precipitation rates, and the number and occurrence days of very intense category 4 and 5 storms.\u201d"}

{"text": "Given that the vast majority of damage from storms like Hurricanes Harvey and Florence come from rainfall, these findings raise concerns.\r\n"}
{"text": "Rapid intensification is one of the least well-predicted tropical cyclone processes and also one of the most dangerous, because storms that intensify quickly tend to catch people off guard."}
{"text": "Rapid intensification is another aspect of tropical cyclones characterized by broad agreement among researchers.\r\n"}
{"text": "A 2017 paper by Kerry Emanuel finds that \u201cthe incidence of storms that intensify rapidly just before landfall increases substantially as a result of global warming.\u201d"}
{"text": "To illustrate just how large the changes are, Emanuel quantifies them: \u201cThese results suggest that a storm that intensifies 70 mph in the 24 hours just before landfall, occurring on average once per century in the climate of the late twentieth century, may occur every 5-10 years by the end of this century.\u201d\r\n"}
{"text": "Given the expected boost in intense cyclones, society faces growing threats."}
{"text": "With a combination of stronger storms, sea-level rise, increased coastal populations, and infrastructure exposure, damages and disruptions will continue to mount.\r\n"}
{"text": "Tropical cyclone damages, adjusted for inflation, are rising by approximately 6% per year since 1970.\r\n"}
{"text": "The vast majority of deaths are caused by the most lethal storm systems, and in fact more than half of tropical cyclone-related deaths in the U.S. since 1900 have been caused by just three storms."}
{"text": "Although those mortality numbers are decreasing because of better warnings and preparation, it is easy to see that a future with more intense storms will cause more serious societal impacts.\r\n"}
{"text": "Storm surge is one the deadliest aspects of landfalling tropical systems, responsible for nearly 50% of deaths since 1963."}
{"text": "In itself, even without stronger cyclones, sea-level rise will cause exponential damages and exposures.\r\n"}
{"text": "A warmer climate will also bring some shifts in storm locations."}
{"text": "In the Atlantic basin, this prospect puts areas of the U.S. northeast coast and maritime Canada in greater danger of a stronger hurricane.\r\n"}
{"text": "Using 21st-century climate model projections, a more recent study led by Mingfang Ting of Columbia University concludes that human-caused warming may lead to a weakening of disruptive vertical wind shear during active Atlantic hurricane cycles."}
{"text": "Recall that \u201cwind shear\u201d refers to hostile environmental winds that act as a barrier to storms, helping to weaken and sometimes steer storms away from land."}
{"text": "If this research pans out, wind shear will be less able to weaken future storms along the U.S. East Coast during periods of heightened hurricane activity.\r\n"}
{"text": "This weakening of wind shear is likely to result in more rapid intensification of storms as they near landfall."}
{"text": "Assessing the risk from both wind and storm surge, the author of a 2017 paper concludes: \u201cIn combination, climate change and coastal development will cause hurricane damage to increase faster than the U.S. economy is expected to grow."}

{"text": "The widespread use of antifungal drugs has been suggested as a contributory cause in the emergence of C. auris (3)."}
{"text": "Whereas selection by environmental azole use can certainly have contributed to drug resistance in this fungal species, it does not easily explain why this organism suddenly became a human pathogen on three continents."}
{"text": "The acquisition of drug resistance alone is very unlikely to confer upon a microbe the capacity for pathogenicity, since reduced susceptibility to drugs and virulence are very different properties, as evidenced by frequent fitness costs associated with mutations conferring resistance to antifungals to Candida (4, 5)."}
{"text": "Instead, as exemplified by the experience with Aspergillus fumigatus, aspergillosis was a well-known clinical entity before its putative acquisition of drug resistance from the agricultural use of azoles (6)."}

{"text": "Factors that increase the destructive potential of hurricanes\r\n"}
{"text": "The oceans have taken in nearly all of the excess energy created by global warming, absorbing 93 percent of the increase in the planet\u2019s energy inventory from 1971-2010.\r\n"}
{"text": "Human-made global warming creates conditions that increase the chances of extreme weather."}
{"text": "In some ocean basins, the intensification of hurricanes over time has been linked to rising ocean temperatures."}
{"text": "This warming is especially pronounced in the North Atlantic basin.\r\n"}

{"text": "Hurricanes require high humidity, relatively constant winds at different altitudes, and can occur when surface ocean temperatures exceed about 79"}
{"text": "The rising of warm, moist air from the ocean helps to power the storm.\r\n"}
{"text": "Two other factors may also be contributing to the rising intensities of hurricanes."}
{"text": "First, warm air holds more water vapor than cold air\u2014and the rising air temperatures since the 1970s have caused the atmospheric water vapor content to rise as well."}
{"text": "Climate models project an increase in the average precipitation rate of hurricanes as a result of global warming.\r\n"}

{"text": "There is evidence that climate change may increase vertical wind shear over some regions in the western tropical Atlantic Ocean.\r\n"}
{"text": "These naturally occurring oscillations affect ocean conditions on timescales ranging from just a few years to several decades and are known to affect the intensity of hurricanes.\r\n"}
{"text": "During the warm, or El Ni\u00f1o, phase of the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), for example, hurricanes are less likely to make landfall in eastern Australia and Atlantic hurricanes tend to be suppressed."}
{"text": "However, El Ni\u00f1o conditions can boost typhoon risks in parts of Asia.\r\n"}
{"text": "The presence of these natural oscillations can mask or enhance the potential influence of human-caused warming on hurricane activity."}
{"text": "Recent scientific studies increasingly question whether human activities have contributed to observed shifts in natural circulation patterns.\r\n"}
{"text": "There is some evidence that there will be an increase in the frequency of the most intense storms, though there is more evidence of this finding for the eastern North Pacific than there is for the western North Pacific and Atlantic.\r\n"}

{"text": "The clearest connection is with warming air temperatures."}

{"text": "That might not seem like very much warming, but just a little can go a long way."}
{"text": "The hotter and drier the air, the more it sucks up, and the amount of water it can hold increases exponentially as the temperature rises; small increases in the air's heat can mean big increases in the intensity with which it pulls out water."}
{"text": "Intense, record-breaking heat waves like the ones that encompassed the West during August and early September likely caused major crisping of burnable material, as the regional vapor pressure deficit and associated drought climbed to record levels.\r\n"}

{"text": "When excess heat stays in place for months or longer, the wildfire risk rises even further.\r\n"}
{"text": "An early, warm spring can jump-start a summer drought by extending the season of heat and growth, increasing the amount of water vapor that is shed by plant leaves or that evaporates directly from soil."}
{"text": "When there\u2019s no moisture left to evaporate, the soil or vegetation, dead and alive, absorbs that heat instead\u2014feeding back into the drying-out process that increases fire risk.\r\n"}

{"text": "Since the 1970s, a recent study found, human-caused climate change caused more than half of the drying-out of burnable materials and consequent fire risk.\r\n"}

{"text": "Because these kinds of blazes are ignited by lightning and burn relatively unimpeded across the wilderness, such trends can be caused only by climate change.\r\n"}
{"text": "Climate change models predict that we will see meteorological extremes that produce catastrophic fires in unexpected places and outside of normal fire seasons."}
{"text": "For instance, an exceptional drought produced a fatal wildfire in the Great Smoky Mountains of Tennessee in 2016, when blazes near Gatlinburg burned more than 10,000 acres and killed 14 people."}

{"text": "Neither of these blazes could be blamed on poor forest management.\r\n"}
{"text": "And a century of fire suppression has altered forests by increasing the density of trees per acre and allowing undergrowth to build up \u2014 all of which becomes fuel when a wildfire ignites."}

{"text": "Abstract\r\nA major step towards achieving the goals of the Paris agreement would be a measurable change in the evolution of global warming in response to mitigation of anthropogenic emissions."}
{"text": "The inertia and internal variability of the climate system, however, will delay the emergence of a discernible response even to strong, sustained mitigation."}
{"text": "Here, we investigate when we could expect a significant change in the evolution of global mean surface temperature after strong mitigation of individual climate forcers."}
{"text": "Current observed climate change is primarily the net result of a range of anthropogenic emissions and other physical changes to the global environment1,2."}
{"text": "Since the 1970s, this anthropogenic forcing has resulted in increased global mean surface temperature (GMST) at a rate of on average 0.2 \u00b0C per decade3, and most future projections see this overall evolution continuing for several decades regardless of emission scenario4."}
{"text": "While changes in the growth rates of atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases might be more readily discernible5, the central indicator of progress would be a reduction in the rate of surface warming relative to what is anticipated under some assumed baseline emission scenario (or, in practice, the rate observed over the last decades).\r\n"}
{"text": "On annual-to-decadal scales, this rate of warming is however substantially affected by the interplay between anthropogenic forcing and internal variability."}
{"text": "Previously, Tebaldi and Friedlingstein7 (hereafter TF13) have quantified the expected delayed detection of climate mitigation benefits due to climate inertia and variability."}

{"text": "But with shorter winters, less snow has time to build up, leading to drier vegetation.\r\n"}
{"text": "As winters warm up, snowpack can melt earlier in the spring, which leads to a process that causes soils to become drier, an effect that can compound over years."}
{"text": "Rain doesn\u2019t store as easily, so it can contribute to flooding early in the season but quickly run off into the ocean, leaving less moisture for the rest of the year.\r\n"}

{"text": "We\u2019re still not doing enough to reduce the looming disaster risks\r\n"}

{"text": "Abstract\r\nUsing over a century of ground-based observations over the contiguous United States, we show that the frequency of compound dry and hot extremes has increased substantially in the past decades, with an alarming increase in very rare dry-hot extremes."}
{"text": "We show that dry-hot extremes have homogeneously enlarged over the past 122 years, pointing to spatial propagation of extreme dryness and heat and increased probability of continental-scale compound extremes."}
{"text": "Last, we show an interesting shift between the main driver of dry-hot extremes over time."}
{"text": "While meteorological drought was the main driver of dry-hot events in the 1930s, the observed warming trend has become the dominant driver in recent decades."}
{"text": "Our results provide a deeper understanding of spatiotemporal variation of compound dry-hot extremes.\r\n"}
{"text": "For example, studies have shown that heatwave magnitudes, frequencies, intensities, and spatial extents are increasing over many regions (2), a trend that is projected to continue in a warming climate (3)."}
{"text": "Moreover, analyses of historical precipitation, streamflow, and soil moisture indices show an increasing trend of aridity over many regions around the globe (4), and model simulations point to an increasing drought hazard in the 21st century."}
{"text": "These extreme events can individually cause significant adverse impacts; however, their concurrence can be even more devastating (5, 6)."}
{"text": "For example, the compounding effects of drought and hot temperatures can significantly increase tree mortality, which, in turn, may cascade into other hazards, such as wildfires (7)."}
{"text": "Concurrent drought and heatwaves are the most damaging climatic stressors to wheat production with grave implications for global food security; they can also jeopardize electric grid reliability and adversely affect a wide range of natural and built systems (8)."}
{"text": "In the United States alone, three concurrent drought and heatwave events between 2011 and 2013 caused damages equaling roughly 60 billion U.S. dollars (USD).\r\n"}
{"text": "Droughts and heatwaves, for example, are typically initiated by similar synoptic circulation anomalies; however, local- and regional-scale land-atmosphere feedbacks drive the evolution of compound drought-heatwave events and intensify both extremes (10)."}
{"text": "Background warming due to anthropogenic emissions, for example, triggers earlier initiation of and stronger land-atmosphere feedback loops and extends their spatial impact across North America (12), which can, in turn, intensify compound drought-heatwave extremes and spread their spatial extent."}
{"text": "Across the contiguous United States (CONUS), concurrent droughts and heatwaves have increased with a statistically significant shift in their distribution between 1990 and 2010 and 1960 and 1980 (14)."}
{"text": "In addition, concurrent moderate droughts and heatwaves have increased across portions of India (15), and meteorological droughts are associated with a faster warming rate than the average climate over southern and northeastern United States (16).\r\n"}
{"text": "Land-atmosphere feedbacks can intensify drought-heatwave extremes through two mechanisms: self-intensification and self-propagation (17)."}
{"text": "Self-intensification refers to droughts and heatwaves intensifying one another, and self-propagation refers to the spreading of droughts and heatwaves from one region to downwind regions (10, 18)."}
{"text": "Previous examinations of compound hot-dry events (and their derivatives, i.e., compound drought-heatwave events) have focused on synoptic circulation patterns that initiate these extremes and self-intensifying land-atmosphere processes that drive the evolution of these events (1, 13, 16)."}
{"text": "This process, as manifested through trends in the spatial homogeneity\u2014connectedness\u2014of concurrent dry-hot extremes, has received less attention in past studies."}
{"text": "Further, most of the literature only analyzes the concurrence of droughts and heatwaves after 1950s (14, 15, 19), which overlooks the megadrought of the 1930s (13)."}
{"text": "We define compound dry-hot extremes as years with joint return periods of precipitation deficit and heat excess of longer than 25 years (joint annual exceedance probability of less than 0.04), unless otherwise stated."}
{"text": "Our results show that the frequency of compound dry-hot extremes is increasing across CONUS, a trend that is significant at the 5% level over the western United States and parts of the northeastern and southeastern United States."}
{"text": "This has significant socio-environmental repercussions as larger and more intense extreme events can rapidly deplete regional and national relief resources."}
{"text": "This knowledge can help assess regional-to-continental vulnerabilities of natural and built systems under climate change and inform adaptation and mitigation efforts to curb the grave compounding impacts of multiple extremes (21).\r\n"}
{"text": "While trends in both precipitation and temperature have significant socio-environmental implications, their interdependence can intensify the impacts of the anomalous state of each driver (11)."}
{"text": "For example, extreme temperatures can induce \u201cflash droughts\u201d with devastating impacts such as causing large wildfires (23, 24)."}
{"text": "This finding seems counterintuitive at first glance, as background warming is believed to have strengthened land-atmosphere feedbacks (12)."}
{"text": "At the annual scale, the more pronounced warming rate of winters (figs."}
{"text": "S2 and S3)\u2014due to anthropogenic background warming\u2014overwhelms the land-atmosphere feedback effects that are activated in the warm season."}
{"text": "Nevertheless, increasing temperature trends increases the probability of concurrence of dry and hot extremes.\r\n"}
{"text": "Temporal trends in compound dry-hot extremes\r\n"}
{"text": "This definition is intuitive for univariate extremes, such as dryness."}
{"text": "Here, we use the AND hazard scenario, which determines the probability (or frequency) of a compound dry-hot event, i.e., drier than a threshold AND hotter than a threshold (26)."}
{"text": "We use the empirical copula and the entire 122 years of the record to estimate the joint exceedance probabilities of dryness and heat excess."}
{"text": "Winter temperature has important environmental implications ranging from snowmelt and water availability to phenology and wildlife health."}
{"text": "Mean annual temperature is also closely associated with soil respiration that has important feedbacks with climate."}
{"text": "Moreover, an increase in mean annual temperature is associated with a pronounced likelihood of extreme heat events (28).\r\n"}
{"text": "The frequency of >25-year compound dry-hot extremes (joint return period levels exceeding 25 years) has significantly increased over the last three quarter-century periods (Fig. 2, A to C)."}
{"text": "In the most recent period (1993\u20132017), however, there is a spike in the number of >25-year compound dry-hot extremes, with several climate divisions observing more than five such compound events."}

{"text": "Multiple >75-year compound events are observed in the coastal Pacific Northwest, inland Southern California, Florida, Maine, and several climate divisions in Texas, which point to the intensification of compound dry-hot extremes over many portions of CONUS with significant socio-environmental repercussions, such as causing very large wildfires (29).\r\n"}
{"text": "(14) that show an increasing frequency of concurrence of precipitation and temperature extremes over the globe and CONUS, respectively."}
{"text": "This discrepancy stems from differences in the definitions of compound events, along with differences in the study period."}

{"text": "This longer time period can add significant information on the frequency of compound dry-hot extremes, as it includes the megadrought of the 1930s (discussed in the next section).\r\n"}
{"text": "Spatial trends in compound dry-hot extremes\r\n"}
{"text": "Our analysis points to a substantial increase in the number of climate divisions observing >25-year compound dry-hot extremes after the 1950s across all climate regions in the CONUS (Fig."}
{"text": "More specifically, there is no increasing trend observed in the number of climate divisions observing >25-year compound dry-hot extremes for the Great Plains, Midwest, and Southeast, and to some extent"}
{"text": "However, there is an interesting shift in the nature of the dominant driver for these compound events."}
{"text": "In the 1930s, a long, severe dry event that engulfed two-thirds of CONUS was the dominant driver of the joint probability of compound dry-hot extremes."}
{"text": "This drought contributed to the infamous dust storms of the Southern Great Plains (30)."}
{"text": "In the mid-2000s, however, both precipitation deficit and heat excess contributed to the compound events across many climate regions (Fig. 3, A, B, and G), and since 2010, hotter years became the main driver of the compound events across all the climate regions (Fig. 3, A to G)."}
{"text": "This observation is in accordance with the findings of Mo and Lettenmaier (24), who reported that heatwave-driven flash droughts have shown an increasing trend across CONUS since 2011."}
{"text": "This implies that the dominant triggering driver of the land-atmosphere feedback has shifted from dryness in the earlier half of the study to excess heat in recent decade(s).\r\n"}
{"text": "Over the entire CONUS, the number of climate divisions with >25-, >50-, and >75-year compound dry-hot extremes shows an increasing trend, with >75-year events having the highest rate of increase (i.e., a larger slope of linear regression; Fig. 3, H to J)."}
{"text": "These results also confirm the shift in the main driver of the compound extreme events from dry years in the 1930s to hot years in recent decade(s)."}
{"text": "Many compound event studies focus on the concurrence of droughts and heatwaves, and, in general terms, dry and hot years, over the past 3 to 6 decades (15, 19, 31)."}
{"text": "We argue that the literature might underestimate the risks of compound dry-hot extremes by neglecting to account for longer climatic cycles and lower frequency events, such as the 1930s drought."}
{"text": "While internal stochastic\u2014not forced\u2014atmospheric variability alone is able to create both megadroughts (35) and megaheatwaves (36), anthropogenic emissions have considerably increased their probability of occurrence (37) and, most importantly, their concurrence (13).\r\n"}
{"text": "Furthermore, the area affected by >25-year hot years is also associated with an increasing trend across all climate regions, which is determined to be nonsignificant at the 10% level."}
{"text": "Spatial homogeneity of compound dry-hot extremes\r\n"}
{"text": "It is also important to analyze homogeneity of the area affected by compound dry-hot extremes."}
{"text": "Homogeneous compound dry-hot events might fragment this connectedness and result in population collapse."}
{"text": "In the context of built systems, homogeneous compound extremes can damage harvests across a wide range of agricultural lands and rapidly deplete federal and local relief resources.\r\n"}
{"text": "Here, we assess the connectedness of climate divisions that experience >25-year compound dry-hot extremes."}
{"text": "If the past 50 years alone are analyzed, the homogeneous spatial growth of >25-year compound dry-hot years shows an even steeper slope, mainly driven by the homogeneous enlargement of hot years (fig."}
{"text": "Persistent large-scale circulation anomalies are generally known to initiate drought and heatwave events and their co-occurrence; however, land-atmosphere feedbacks can also intensify and propagate those anomalous climatic events (40)."}
{"text": "Megaheatwaves, for example, are usually preceded by persistent anticyclones, enabling cloud-free conditions and advection of hot air (40), but drier soils intensify heatwaves by partitioning the incoming solar radiation into more sensible and less latent heat."}
{"text": "It is noted that megaheatwaves can be generated by natural atmospheric variability even without land-atmosphere feedbacks (36)."}
{"text": "However, land-atmosphere feedbacks increase the probability of occurrence of megaheatwaves (41)."}
{"text": "For example, the probability of the Russian 2010 megaheatwave event increased 13-fold due to the self-intensification feedback of drought and heatwave (42)."}
{"text": "With a lack of soil moisture, evaporation decreases as does partitioning of solar radiation into latent heat; hence, a larger fraction of the incoming radiation is translated into sensible heat, which, in turn, warms the environment (43)."}
{"text": "Desiccated soils contribute to temperature increase, heat entrainment, and deepening of the atmospheric boundary layer."}
{"text": "This cycle of drying and warming inhibits the formation of clouds and, in turn, restrains local convective precipitation, further intensifying drought (40).\r\n"}
{"text": "A less explored mechanism of land-atmosphere feedback is self-propagation (40)."}
{"text": "While heat advection and its impact on the formation and expansion of heatwaves have been explored in the literature, especially for the 2003 European and 2010 Russian megaheatwaves (44), terrestrially sourced atmospheric moisture advection has been explored in less detail but is receiving more attention in the recent literature (18)."}
{"text": "The propagation of droughts is more important for regions that depend on terrestrially sourced precipitation, including large parts of North America (45)."}
{"text": "Our analysis shows that compound dry-hot extremes have enlarged homogeneously, i.e., impacted areas are increasingly becoming connected, pointing to the propagation of atmospheric moisture deficit AND heat from one region to its neighboring regions."}
{"text": "Connected spatial growth of compound dry-hot events can have significant natural and societal repercussions."}
{"text": "An example of a spatially large and severe compound extreme is the summer 2010 drought and heatwave in Russia that decreased crop production by 25%, caused >500 wildfires that burned more than 1 million ha, and induced an estimated 15 billion USD economic loss (46).\r\n"}
{"text": "Our results show that the frequency of compound dry-hot extremes in CONUS has substantially increased in the past 50 years, a trend that is less pronounced if a longer period of analysis (1896\u20132017) is used."}
{"text": "While anomalous synoptic circulation patterns are recognized for initiation of compound dry-hot events, background warming due to anthropogenic emissions has strengthened, caused the earlier start of, and extended the spatial impact of land-atmosphere feedbacks in North America (12)."}
{"text": "We report that there is a shift in the dominant driver of compound dry-hot extremes from precipitation deficit in the 1930s to heat excess in recent decade(s)."}
{"text": "In other words, the dominant driver that triggers land-atmosphere feedbacks has changed from meteorological drought to excess heat."}
{"text": "This is in concept similar to the precipitation deficit\u2013driven and heatwave-driven flash drought categorization of Mo and Lettenmaier (24, 47), despite differences in the temporal scale."}
{"text": "Although flash droughts of all categories are shown to have increased in frequency across the globe in the last century, Mo and Lettenmaier (24) show that the frequency of heatwave-driven flash droughts was associated with a decreasing trend over the last century, which rebounded after 2011."}
{"text": "This agrees with our argument of the changing nature of the dominant driver of compound dry-hot events in the recent decade, i.e., precipitation deficit to heat excess."}
{"text": "Further, while natural variability is able to create compound events, anthropogenic emissions have significantly enhanced the probability of concurrent drought and heatwaves, and only aggressive emission reduction can mitigate the risks associated with their increasing frequency (13)."}
{"text": "We argue that recent literature may underestimate the risks of concurrent dry and hot episodes, as they only study the post-1950s period without recourse to the 1930s meteorological drought that engulfed two-thirds of CONUS for almost a decade."}
{"text": "We argue that if meteorological droughts of the length and severity observed in the 1930s occur during the hot years that are increasingly common in recent decades due to global warming, their concurrence can have devastating impacts (5, 32, 48)."}
{"text": "Moreover, a hotter climate increases water demand (50), concurrence of which with dry years would strain social, built, and natural systems (7) and might push them to unprecedented states (51)."}
{"text": "The consequences of the increased frequency, intensity, and spatial homogeneity of climatic extremes for compound events with multiple drivers are far graver than the effect of each driver individually (9), and risk assessment frameworks need to consider the compounding effects of multiple extremes rather than addressing one driver at a time within the traditional univariate framework.\r\n"}
